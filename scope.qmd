# Data scope

Data scope refers to the type and breadth of data needed for your project. Defining your scope makes it clear what data will need to be collected or retrieved in order to answer your research question and will streamline your research process. 


**Your research question will help guide the scope of data you need.**


Consider the following in reference to your research aim:

-   What is the **taxonomic** unit of your research question?

    *A broader genera or a species? Is it threatened?*

-   What is the **spatial** scale of your research question?

    *The entire country? A specific conservation area?*

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Note

Your data scope may change according to the availability of data. While the species could be predicted to occur across wide area, data on your species may only be available in a certain locality of that area, or, records could be limited due to the rarity or difficulty of surveying the species. Biodiversity data of this nature can be analysed in a few ways (e.g. [using alpha or convex hulls)](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-10-12_alpha-hulls/post.html).

## Taxonomic scope

<!-- I don't think the tone is quite right on this section and might need some massaging to get right. I think we are trying to suggest that investigating what data is available is a necessary first step to understand how detailed you can get about a specific question. Then you should think critically about whether the available data is suitable. If it's viable to increase data scope, then this might be a useful way to increase data (but at the expense of granularity of detail)   -->

When the aim is to gather data on a specific taxonomic unit, **reducing** or **increasing** your taxonomic scope may be relevant for a few reasons:

-   Your research requires more data and the research question is viable at a higher taxonomic level (genus, family, order, class..)

-   Species specific questions are being asked, and you need to refine your taxonomic scope.

Depending on these factors your first data download query will be performed using the **scientific name** or the **taxonomic group name**.

For example, if we were investigating the Green Jewel Bug versus the Red Jewel Bug at the species' level in Australia, we would use *Lampromicra senator* and *Lampromicra aerea*.

```{r}
#map Lampromicra senator and aerea
lampromicra <- open_dataset("data/galah/lampromicra") |> collect()
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = lampromicra,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, colour = scientificName),
    size = 2,
  ) +
  ylim(-45, -10) +
  xlim(110, 155) +
  theme_void()
```

Curious what *Lampromicra senator* looks like?

</aside>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true

library(galah)
galah_config(email = "ALAemailaddress", atlas = "Australia")

lampromicra <- galah_call() |>
galah_identify("Lampromicra aerea", "Lampromicra senator") |>
galah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022) |>
galah_select(group = "basic") |>
atlas_occurrences()

library(ggplot2)
 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = lampromicra,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, color = scientificName),
    size = 2,
  ) +
  ylim(-45, -10) +
  xlim(110, 155) +
  theme_void()
```

At a wider scale we can look at that *genus* of bugs, *Lampromicra*, as a larger, encompassing **taxonomic group**.

```{r}
#map Lampromicra senator and aerea
lampromicra <- open_dataset("data/galah/lampromicragenus") |> collect()
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = lampromicra,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, color = genus),
    size = 2,
  ) +
  ylim(-45, -10) +
  xlim(110, 155) +
  theme_void()
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true

library(galah)
galah_config(email = "ALAemailaddress", atlas = "Australia")

lampromicra <- galah_call() |>
galah_identify("Lampromicra") |>
galah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022) |>
galah_select(group = "basic", genus) |>
atlas_occurrences()

library(ggplot2)
 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = lampromicra,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, color = genus),
    size = 2,
  ) +
  ylim(-45, -10) +
  xlim(110, 155) +
  theme_void()
```

## Spatial scope

<!-- Same suggestion as in the above chapter that this might need some rewording to show how investigating data at different spatial scales is useful for defining what scope is realistic for your project/question. The goal (I think) might be to similarly show a preview of what investigating data by different sized regions might be useful (or checking which regions have the most data, and just working in that area).  -->

When the aim is to obtain data for targeted taxa in a given location, [it might be useful to see how much data there is at different spatial scales.]

-   the **region name**, or;

-   the **area boundaries**

can be used to delimit the area of interest.\
\
The example below shows all **Insect orders** in the state of Tasmania, Australia:

<!-- Note that we are plotting only 10% of all dataset here  -->

```{r}
insects <- open_dataset("data/galah/insects") |> collect()
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = insects,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, colour = order),
    size = 0.3,
  ) +
  ylim(-44, -39) +
  xlim(144.7, 148.5) +
  theme_void()

```

## Naming authorities

<!-- Define what naming authority is -->

<!-- How to choose -->

<!--   query with your ideal species list, some systems fuzzy match and will have synonyms -->

<!--     getting all the name columns including your own preferred naming authority to check if you back correct -->

### Choosing your taxonomic naming authority

Naming authorities are the different organisations that provide updated or revised lists of species, and where they fit on the taxonomic tree <!--Is this definition from somewhere? Might be good to try to find one (though in a quick google, this isn't easy-->. Species names in these lists vary as there may be disagreements as to what distinguishes a new genus, species, subspecies etc. <!--Again, might be good to find this from somewhere else because I don't think that's necessarily always why - some groups consider higher taxonomic clades unified or separate, so it's not just species/genera-->

Open source repositories are often provided with conflicting taxonomies that leave them open to a degree of error <!--Not sure if you wrote this but I think it's not clear what this means? I think this is referring to the fact that open source repositories might contain data from many taxonomies so they need to be checked and mapped according to one to avoid errors?-->.

Choosing a naming authority is, then, one one way to make decisions surrounding taxonomic categorisations of open source biodiversity data. However, deciding what naming authority to use can be both challenging and time consuming.

Accurate species delimitation is also crucial for adequate conservation management and understanding evolutionary processes ([Mace 2004](http://localhost:3271/references.html#ref-mace2004role)). Species level lists are the foundation of many conservation decisions: such as the IUCN conservation status classification system. Taxonomic scope therefore has an effect on research application impacts.

What you choose will depend on your own taxonomic research and evaluation, but also your scope.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Note

A spatial scope will have many species and may need multiple naming authorities. Similarly, choosing a naming authority may impact your scope by shrinking or enlarging datasets in that it will exclude records outside of that authority (unless converted). **This data change might influence your choice to use a naming authority from a single taxonomic society group or multiple broad sources.**
:::

<!-- I don't think I understand the above suggestion? I think you need to choose one authority to work from, but some might be more difficult to work with than others. In general, there is usually one or two authorities that are broadly agreed upon, so this shouldn't be too difficult. I'd suggest removing the note. -->

-   Check changes in the taxonomy of your focus species.

    This can be helpful when interpreting old data which may have species names you don't recognize, or, when using data citing a different naming authority to another data set you wish to consolidate it with. **This can be achieved by consulting the taxonomic literature.**

-   Most taxonomic society groups also release annual updates on taxonomy.

In Australia, the [Australian Plant Name Index (APNI)](https://www.anbg.gov.au/apni/) is the primary naming authority for plants. With the [Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)](https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home) the main taxonomic catalog for animal species.

These authorities provide a list of accepted and authoritative names as a template. If you're unsure what naming authority to use and you're looking at Australian species, the APNI and the AFD are a good place to start, especially if the data you're investigating covers a wide range of taxa. If you're investigating specific taxa it's worth checking when the taxonomy was last updated in the APNI or AFD, especially if you know there has been recent changes. If you want to investigate closer, we've provided some links to society groups, in some cases these can be more up to date that the APNI or AFD.

**insert a mapped example of data changes when changing taxonomic naming authority?**

<!-- The above seems like a difficult ask. Maybe we can find a good example from somewhere online? Maybe we can ask Fonti whether she had something in mind? I think we need an example of a group where this happens, and then create a small taxonomic tree to show these differences -->



<!-- Is the below content things that were drawn on to write the above? Including references to be inserted? If it isn't, it seems to be repeating things and could probably be deleted. I do like Margot's image though! I think generally the book needs more visuals  -->

For example, the ALA uses multiple naming authorities in a hierarchical format:

(note image is from a helpfile I wrote- we can re-do it so it's consistent with the style of this document)

\*\*remake this? simplify? or remove entirely\*\*

![](images/image-1066364510.png)

<!-- Looking at this with fresh eyes makes me realise how much this overcomplicates what is communicated in this section. All we are trying to do is provide some examples of taxonomic authorities that a data infrastructure like the ALA uses, and that it's worth double checking this when you download open source data. I think this should be reduced to a table with only the left column included. -->

\*\*make this shorter and include somewhere\*\*\
\
With all that, open source data has many pros, so how does one deal with taxonomic inconsistencies to get the most accurate data in the end?

While this is in theory how the ALAs backbone is built, issues can occur with aggregation leading to potentially serious problems with the taxonomic structure. In addition data can be parsed incorrectly, and the process isn't transparent. Meaning that when the taxonomic backbone is updated, the elements that have changed are untraceable. These issues are not specific to ALA taxonomy, but occur in varying forms among data aggregators.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Code to generate data that is in this page

# galah_config(email = ALA_mail, atlas = "Australia")

# lampromicra <- galah_call() %>%
#   galah_identify("Lampromicra aerea", "Lampromicra senator"
#                  ) %>%
#   galah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022)%>%
#   galah_select(group = "basic")%>%
#   atlas_occurrences()
# 
# arrow::write_parquet(lampromicra, "data/galah/lampromicra")
#
# insects <- galah_call() |>
#   galah_identify("Insecta") |>
#   galah_filter(stateProvince == "Tasmania") |>
#    galah_select(group = "basic", order) |>
#   atlas_occurrences()
# 
# insects |> 
#   arrow::write_parquet("data/galah/insects")

```
