# Data scope

Data scope pertains to the type of data needed for your project, your research question will help guide the scope of data you need.

Consider the following to in reference to your research aim:

-   What is the **taxonomic** unit of your research interest?
-   What is the **spatial** scale of your project? The entire country? A specific conservation area?

Your data scope may change according to the availability of data for certain research interests. In some instances, rare species tend to have considerably fewer records.

## Taxonomic scope

Where the aim of the study is to gather data on a specific taxonomic unit. This could be a threatened species or a broad taxonomic group. The download query is performed using the scientific name or name of the taxonomic group.

```{r}
#map Lampromicra senator
lampromicra <- read_csv("data/galah/lampromicra.csv")
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = lampromicra,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, colour = scientificName),
    size = 2,
  ) +
  ylim(-45, -10) +
  xlim(110, 155) +
  theme_void()
```

## Spatial scope

Where the aim is to obtain data for targeted taxa in a given location. In this case, the region name or area boundaries can be used to delimit the area of interest. The example below shows all Insecta orders in the state of Tasmania in Australia

<!-- Note that we are plotting only 10% of all dataset here  -->

```{r}
insects <- read_csv("data/galah/insects.csv")
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = "#B7CD96") +
  geom_point(
    data = insects,
    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, colour = order),
    size = 0.3,
  ) +
  ylim(-44, -39) +
  xlim(144.7, 148.5) +
  theme_void()

## Naming authorities

<!-- Define what naming authority is -->
<!-- How to choose -->
<!--   query with your ideal species list, some systems fuzzy match and will have synonyms -->
<!--     getting all the name columns including your own preferred naming authority to check if you back correct -->


### Choosing your own naming authority

Using a naming authority is a great way to make decisions surrounding taxonomic categorizations of open source biodiversity data. However, deciding what naming authority to use can be challenging and time consuming.

What naming authority you choose will most certainly depend on your data scope. Spatial focus, will have many species and may need multiple naming authorities.

A knowledge of taxonomy assist your ability to verify the data you are working with. For this, different organizations provide updated lists of species or even details of the taxonomic history of a species.

Checking changes in taxonomy can be helpful when interpreting old data which may have species names you don't recognize.

Changes in taxonomy, such as species split, new higher level classification (as genera), or species descriptions, highlight the importance of keeping up-to-date with taxonomic literature. This can be achieved by consulting the literature. Most taxonomic society groups release annual updates on taxonomy.

In Australia, the [Australian Plant Name Index (APNI)](https://www.anbg.gov.au/apni/) is the primary naming authority for plants. With the [Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)](https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home) the main taxonomic catalog for animal species. These authorities provide a list of accepted and authoritative names as a template. If you're unsure what naming authority to use and you're looking at Australian species, the APNI and the AFD are a good place to start, especially if the data you're investigating covers a wide range of taxa. If you're investigating specific taxa it's worth checking when the taxonomy was last updated in the APNI or AFD, especially if you know there has been recent changes. If you want to investigate closer, we've provided some links to society groups, in some cases these can be more up to date that the APNI or AFD.

## Naming authorities

Accurate species delimitation is crucial for adequate conservation management and understanding evolutionary processes [@mace2004role]. Species-level lists are the foundation of conservation decisions, such as is the IUCN Red List [@melville21].

The difference in scope might influence if you choose to use a naming authority from a taxonomic society group or multiple broad sources.

## Naming authorities and taxonomy in biodiversity databases

When you download data from different databases you might be faced with inconsistencies between the datasets. This is a challenge that data aggregators face when ingesting and aggregating data. This is a large task with lots of heterogeneity and can lead to errors along the way. To help deal with naming inconsistencies, naming authorities are used by online biodiversity databases in order to classify species \[REF\]. Different databases might use different naming authorities, and you might not agree with their classifications. There may be other issues you are not aware of: For example, the ALA uses multiple naming authorities in a hierarchical format:

(note image is from a helpfile I wrote- we can re-do it so it's consistent with the style of this document)

![](images/image-1066364510.png)

With all that, open source data has many pros, so how does one deal with taxonomic inconsistencies to get the most accurate data in the end?

While this is in theory how the ALAs backbone is built, issues can occur with aggregation leading to potentially serious problems with the taxonomic structure. In addition data can be parsed incorrectly, and the process isn't transparent. Meaning that when the taxonomic backbone is updated, the elements that have changed are untraceable. These issues are not specific to ALA taxonomy, but occur in varying forms among data aggregators.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Code to generate data that is in this page

# galah_config(email = ALA_mail, atlas = "Australia")

# lampromicra <- galah_call() %>%
#   galah_identify("Lampromicra aerea", "Lampromicra senator"
#                  ) %>%
#   galah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022)%>%
#   galah_select(group = "basic")%>%
#   atlas_occurrences()
# 
# arrow::write_parquet(lampromicra, "data/galah/lampromicra")
#
# insects <- galah_call() |>
#   galah_identify("Insecta") |>
#   galah_filter(stateProvince == "Tasmania") |>
#    galah_select(group = "basic", order) |>
#   atlas_occurrences()
# 
# insects |> 
#   arrow::write_parquet("data/galah/insects")

```
