## Alternative methods

Here we document some other existing methods that can be used for outlier
detection, and their limitations.

-  Species Distribution Modelling for outlier detection: 
    - [@simoes2018utility](https://doi.org/10.1111/icad.12288)
    - Maximum Entropy modelling (MaxEnt) was used to model habitat suitability
    for five species of leaf beetles in the genus *Mesomphalia*
    - The method relies on the assumption that an errornous point will have a
    lower habitat suitability value than a true point. 
    - For their dataset, the method was useful for identifying geographical
    position errors, but not species level identification errors.
