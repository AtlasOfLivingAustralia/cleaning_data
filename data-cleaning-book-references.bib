Yet, methodological problems result from the use of plant names, particularly in data that originate from numerous and heterogeneous sources. One of the main problems is the inordinate number of synonyms that can be found in vegetation lists. 2.?We present Taxonstand, an r package to automatically standardise plant names using The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org). The scripts included in this package allow connection to the online search engine of the Plant List and retrieve information from each species about its current taxonomic status. In those cases where the species name is a synonym, it is replaced by the current accepted name. In addition, this package can help correcting orthographic errors in specific epithets. 3.?This tool greatly facilitates the preparation of large vegetation databases prior to their analyses, particularly when they cover broad geographical areas (supranational or even continental scale) or contain data from regions with rich floras where taxonomic problems have not been resolved for many of their taxa. Automated workflows such as the one provided by the taxonstand package can ease considerably this task using a widely accessible working nomenclatural authority list for plant species names such as The Plant List.},

	abstract = {Species records from biological collections are becoming increasingly available online. This unprecedented availability of records has largely supported recent studies in taxonomy, biogeography, macroecology and biodiversity conservation. Biological collections vary in their documentation and notation standards, which have changed through time. For different reasons, neither collections nor data repositories perform the editing, formatting and standardisation of the data, leaving these tasks to the final users of the species records (e.g. taxonomists, ecologists and conservationists). These tasks are challenging, particularly when working with millions of records from hundreds of biological collections. To help collection curators and final users perform those tasks, we introduce plantR, an open-source package that provides a comprehensive toolbox to manage species records from biological collections. The package is accompanied by the proposal of a reproducible workflow to manage this type of data in taxonomy, ecology and biodiversity conservation. It is implemented in R and designed to handle relatively large datasets as fast as possible. Initially designed to handle plant species records, many of the plantR features also apply to other groups of organisms, given that the data structure is similar. The plantR workflow includes tools to (a) download records from different data repositories, (b) standardise typical fields associated with species records, (c) validate the locality, geographical coordinates, taxonomic nomenclature and species identifications, including the retrieval of duplicates across collections, and (d) summarise and export records, including the construction of species lists with vouchers. Other R packages provide tools to tackle some of the workflow steps described above. But in addition to the new tools and resources related to data standardisation and validation, the greatest strength of plantR is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly workflow in one single environment, performing all tasks from data retrieval to export. Thus, plantR can help researchers better assess data quality and avoid data leakage in a wide variety of studies using species records.},

	abstract = {Abstract Digital point-occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and other data providers enable a wide range of research in macroecology and biogeography. However, data errors may hamper immediate use. Manual data cleaning is time-consuming and often unfeasible, given that the databases may contain thousands or millions of records. Automated data cleaning pipelines are therefore of high importance. Taking North American Ephedra as a model, we examined how different data cleaning pipelines (using, e.g., the GBIF web application, and four different R packages) affect downstream species distribution models (SDMs). We also assessed how data differed from expert data. From 13,889 North American Ephedra observations in GBIF, the pipelines removed 31.7\% to 62.7\% false positives, invalid coordinates, and duplicates, leading to datasets between 9484 (GBIF application) and 5196 records (manual-guided filtering). The expert data consisted of 704 records, comparable to data from field studies. Although differences in the absolute numbers of records were relatively large, species richness models based on stacked SDMs (S-SDM) from pipeline and expert data were strongly correlated (mean Pearson's r across the pipelines: .9986, vs. the expert data: .9173). Our results suggest that all R package-based pipelines reliably identified invalid coordinates. In contrast, the GBIF-filtered data still contained both spatial and taxonomic errors. Major drawbacks emerge from the fact that no pipeline fully discovered misidentified specimens without the assistance of taxonomic expert knowledge. We conclude that application-filtered GBIF data will still need additional review to achieve higher spatial data quality. Achieving high-quality taxonomic data will require extra effort, probably by thoroughly analyzing the data for misidentified taxa, supported by experts.},

Using a map of the fires generated from remotely sensed hotspot data we show that, across 11 Australian bioregions, 17 major native vegetation groups were severely burnt, and up to 67–83\% of globally significant rainforests and eucalypt forests and woodlands. Based on geocoded species occurrence data we estimate that {\textbackslash}textgreater50\% of known populations or ranges of 816 native vascular plant species were burnt during the fires, including more than 100 species with geographic ranges more than 500 km across.

	abstract = {Abstract The process of standardizing taxon names, taxonomic name harmonization, is necessary to properly merge data indexed by taxon names. The large variety of taxonomic databases and related tools are often not well described. It is often unclear which databases are actively maintained or what is the original source of taxonomic information. In addition, software to access these databases is developed following non-compatible standards, which creates additional challenges for users. As a result, taxonomic harmonization has become a major obstacle in ecological studies that seek to combine multiple datasets. Here, we review and categorize a set of major taxonomic databases publicly available as well as a large collection of R packages to access them and to harmonize lists of taxon names. We categorized available taxonomic databases according to their taxonomic breadth (e.g. taxon specific vs. multi-taxa) and spatial scope (e.g. regional vs. global), highlighting strengths and caveats of each type of database. We divided R packages according to their function, (e.g. syntax standardization tools, access to online databases, etc.) and highlighted overlaps among them. We present our findings (e.g. network of linkages, data and tool characteristics) in a ready-to-use Shiny web application (available at: https://mgrenie.shinyapps.io/taxharmonizexplorer/). We also provide general guidelines and best practice principles for taxonomic name harmonization. As an illustrative example, we harmonized taxon names of one of the largest databases of community time series currently available. We showed how different workflows can be used for different goals, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses and providing practical solutions to avoid common pitfalls. To our knowledge, our opinionated review represents the most exhaustive evaluation of links among and of taxonomic databases and related R tools. Finally, based on our new insights in the field, we make recommendations for users, database managers and package developers alike.},

	abstract = {The recent availability of species occurrence data from numerous sources, standardized and connected within a single portal, has the potential to answer fundamental ecological questions. These aggregated big biodiversity databases are prone to numerous data errors and biases. The data-user is responsible for identifying these errors and assessing if the data are suitable for a given purpose. Complex technical skills are increasingly required for handling and cleaning biodiversity data, while biodiversity scientists possessing these skills are rare. Here, we estimate the effect of user-level data cleaning on species distribution model (SDM) performance. We implement several simple and easy-to-execute data cleaning procedures, and evaluate the change in SDM performance. Additionally, we examine if a certain group of species is more sensitive to the use of erroneous or unsuitable data. The cleaning procedures used in this research improved SDM performance significantly, across all scales and for all performance measures. The largest improvement in distribution models following data cleaning was for small mammals (1g–100g). Data cleaning at the user level is crucial when using aggregated occurrence data, and facilitating its implementation is a key factor in order to advance data-intensive biodiversity studies. Adopting a more comprehensive approach for incorporating data cleaning as part of data analysis, will not only improve the quality of biodiversity data, but will also impose a more appropriate usage of such data.},

It also allows users to correct several types of taxonomic and geographic errors. We applied the workflow to clean global tree occurrence records. The results showed that among the 30,242,556 occurrence records of 58,034 species extracted from eight databases, only 8,624,319 (28.5\%) records of 22,766 (39.2\%) species were classified as high quality after running through the workflow. Inaccurate and non-standard taxon names appeared as a more severe problem than geographical errors that people are most familiar with. The workflow developed in this study can be easily adapted to clean occurrence records of other taxonomic groups, which allows researchers and practitioners to reduce uncertainties in their findings.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Invertebrates make up the vast majority of fauna species but are often overlooked in impact assessment and conservation response. The extent to which the 2019?2020 Australian megafires overlapped with the range of vertebrate species has been well documented; consequently, substantial resourcing has been directed towards their recovery. Here, we attempt to document the extent of overlap of these megafires with invertebrate species. In doing so, we seek to demonstrate that it is possible and worthwhile to assess the effect of a catastrophic event on a large number of poorly known species. Location Temperate and subtropical Australia. Time period 2019?2020. Major taxa Australian invertebrates. Methods We adapted a published analytical pathway for the assessment of distributional fire overlap on vertebrate species. Overlaps with fire for 32,163 invertebrate taxa were determined using point records and polygons. Results We found that 13,581 invertebrate taxa had part of their range burnt in the 2019?2020 Australian megafires. Of these, 382 taxa had the whole of their known range burnt, and a further 405 taxa had 50?99.9\% of their range burnt. Five examples are described. Main conclusions Poorly known groups of biodiversity can be impacted significantly by major disturbance events, but such impact is often overlooked. This oversight has the consequences of under-estimating the magnitude of impacts and the potential failure to direct conservation responses to those species most in need of them. Our analysis demonstrates that the 2019?2020 megafires burnt ≥50\% of the known range of nearly 800 Australian invertebrate taxa, a tally far higher than for vertebrates (19 taxa). Assessment of the real impact (i.e., beyond simply overlap with fire) requires more consideration of susceptibility and/or post-fire survey and monitoring. The magnitude of overlap of the 2019?2020 megafires on invertebrate species justifies a conservation response that is less biased towards iconic vertebrate species.},

This study presents an analysis of the nature of the problem from first principles, reviews some available algorithmic approaches, and describes Taxamatch, an improved name matching solution for this information domain. Taxamatch employs a custom Modified Damerau-Levenshtein Distance algorithm in tandem with a phonetic algorithm, together with a rule-based approach incorporating a suite of heuristic filters, to produce improved levels of recall, precision and execution time over the existing dynamic programming algorithms n-grams (as bigrams and trigrams) and standard edit distance. Although entirely phonetic methods are faster than Taxamatch, they are inferior in the area of recall since many real-world errors are non-phonetic in nature. Excellent performance of Taxamatch (as recall, precision and execution time) is demonstrated against a reference database of over 465,000 genus names and 1.6 million species names, as well as against a range of error types as present at both genus and species levels in three sets of sample data for species and four for genera alone.

It is organized in thematic modules related to different biodiversity dimensions, including (a) Merge datasets: standardization and integration of different datasets; (b) Pre-filter: flagging and removal of invalid or non-interpretable information, followed by data amendments; (c) Taxonomy: cleaning, parsing and harmonization of scientific names from several taxonomic groups against taxonomic databases locally stored through the application of exact and partial matching algorithms; (d) Space: flagging of erroneous, suspect and low-precision geographic coordinates; and (e) Time: flagging and, whenever possible, correction of inconsistent collection date. In addition, the package contains features to visualize, document and report data quality?which is essential for making data quality assessment transparent and reproducible. The modules illustrated, and functions within, were linked to form a proposed reproducible workflow that can also integrate functions from other R packages. We demonstrated the bdc package's applicability in cleaning more than 30 million occurrence records for terrestrial plant species in Brazil. We found that around one-fifth of the original datasets hold the standard quality requirements. Compared to other available R packages, the main strengths of the bdc package are that it brings together available tools?and a series of new ones?to assess the quality of different dimensions of biodiversity data into a single and flexible toolkit. The functions can be applied to many taxonomic groups, datasets (including regional or local repositories), countries, or world-wide. We hope the bdc package can facilitate the data cleaning process and catalyse improvements to allow the wise and efficient use of primary biodiversity data.},

	abstract = {Occurrence data from museum and herbarium collections are valuable for mapping biodiversity patterns in space and time. Unfortunately these collections datasets contain many errors and suffer from several data quality issues that can influence the quality of the products derived from them. It is up to the user to identify these errors and data quality issues when using these data. Despite the large number of potential users of these datasets there are few software tools dedicated to error detection and correction of collections datasets. The R package biogeo was developed for detecting and correcting errors and for assessing of data quality of collections datasets consisting of occurrence records. Features of the package include error detection, such as mismatches between the recorded country and the country where the record is plotted, records of terrestrial species that fall into the sea and outlier detection. A key feature of the package is the ability to identify likely alternative positions for points that represent obvious errors in the dataset and functions to explore records in geographical and environmental space in order to identify possible errors in the dataset. Functions are also available for converting coordinates that are in various text formats into degrees, minutes and seconds and then into decimal degrees.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity databases are increasingly available and have fostered accelerated advances in many disciplines within ecology and evolution. However, the quality of the evidence generated depends critically on the quality of the input data, and species misidentifications are present in virtually any occurrence dataset. Yet, the lack of automatized tools makes the assessment of the quality of species identification in big datasets time-consuming, which often induces researchers to assume that all species are reliably identified. In this study, we address this issue by evaluating how species misidentification can impact our ability to capture ecological patterns, and by presenting an R package, called naturaList, designed to classify species occurrence data according to identification reliability. naturaList allows the classification of species occurrences up to six confidence levels, in which the highest level is assigned to records identified by specialists. We obtained a list of specialists by using the species occurrence dataset itself, based on the identifier names within it, and by entering an independent list, obtained by contacting experts. Further, we evaluate the effects of filtering out occurrence records not identified by specialists on the estimations of species niche and diversity patterns. We used the tribe Myrteae (Myrtaceae) as a study model, which is a species-rich group in Central and South America and with challenging taxonomy. We found a significant change in species niche in 13\% of species when using only occurrences identified by specialists. We found changes in patterns of alpha diversity in four genera and changes in beta diversity in all genera analyzed. We show how the uncertainty in species identification in occurrence datasets affects conclusions on macroecological patterns by generating bias or noise in different aspects of macroecological patterns (niche, alpha, and beta diversity). Therefore, to guarantee reliability in species identification in big data sets we recommend the use of automated tools such as the naturaList package, especially when analyzing variation in species composition. This study also represents a step forward to increasing the quality of large-scale studies that rely on species occurrence data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Species occurrence records from online databases are an indispensable resource in ecological, biogeographical and palaeontological research. However, issues with data quality, especially incorrect geo-referencing or dating, can diminish their usefulness. Manual cleaning is time-consuming, error prone, difficult to reproduce and limited to known geographical areas and taxonomic groups, making it impractical for datasets with thousands or millions of records. Here, we present CoordinateCleaner, an r-package to scan datasets of species occurrence records for geo-referencing and dating imprecisions and data entry errors in a standardized and reproducible way. CoordinateCleaner is tailored to problems common in biological and palaeontological databases and can handle datasets with millions of records. The software includes (a) functions to flag potentially problematic coordinate records based on geographical gazetteers, (b) a global database of 9,691 geo-referenced biodiversity institutions to identify records that are likely from horticulture or captivity, (c) novel algorithms to identify datasets with rasterized data, conversion errors and strong decimal rounding and (d) spatio-temporal tests for fossils. We describe the individual functions available in CoordinateCleaner and demonstrate them on more than 90 million occurrences of flowering plants from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and 19,000 fossil occurrences from the Palaeobiology Database (PBDB). We find that in GBIF more than 3.4 million records (3.7\%) are potentially problematic and that 179 of the tested contributing datasets (18.5\%) might be biased by rasterized coordinates. In PBDB, 1205 records (6.3\%) are potentially problematic. All cleaning functions and the biodiversity institution database are open-source and available within the CoordinateCleaner r-package.},

            Code review increases reliability and improves reproducibility of research. As such, code review is an inevitable step in software development and is common in fields such as computer science. However, despite its importance, code review is noticeably lacking in ecology and evolutionary biology. This is problematic as it facilitates the propagation of coding errors and a reduction in reproducibility and reliability of published results. To address this, we provide a detailed commentary on how to effectively review code, how to set up your project to enable this form of review and detail its possible implementation at several stages throughout the research process. This guide serves as a primer for code review, and adoption of the principles and advice here will go a long way in promoting more open, reliable, and transparent ecology and evolutionary biology.
            Abstract
            Code review is the process of either informally (as part of a group, as colleagues) or formally (as part of the peer review process) checking and evaluating each other's code and is a critical method of reducing errors and increasing research reproducibility and reliability. In this paper, we provide a detailed commentary on how to effectively review code (including introducing the four Rs), how to set up your project to enable this form of review and detail its possibleimplementation at several stages throughout the research process.},
