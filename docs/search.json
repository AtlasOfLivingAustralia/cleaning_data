Key themes searched were:\n\nCleaning data for species distribution models\nCleaning open biodiversity data\nAustralian and global naming authorities\nR packages for biodiversity data cleaning\n\nAs this was not a comprehensive literature review recent papers were selected first as the R environment is a rapidly evolving space. Methods sections outlining data cleaning protocols were read and collated into a database. Papers which were frequently referenced were also chosen for review in order to not miss older seminal papers. Additionally our project partners outputs (Marsh et al. 2021; Godfree et al. 2021) have been investigated in detail to understand and streamline their data cleaning processes. This has included detailed review of their code base as well as meetings with the authors of the papers to understand their processes, issues and needs.\nAll steps for acquiring and cleaning data were then looked at together in order to understand what were essential steps, versus what was done in certain use cases. We also investigated the order in which steps were undertaken with the idea of developing a streamlined workflow. However the diagrams below show the complexity of this, with data cleaning being extremely iterative.\n \n\n\n\n\nGodfree, Robert C., Nunzio Knerr, Francisco Encinas-Viso, David Albrecht, David Bush, D.

    "text": "This book acts as a general guide on downloading and cleaning biodiversity data using R. If you are new to working with biodiversity data in R, or hoping to add some tips and code examples to your toolbox, then this book is for you. However, this is not a guide to R itself, and so a basic familiarity with the language is recommended.\nWe will cover the most common steps associated with cleaning open-access georeferenced biodiversity data, broken down into three sections. An overview of the three sections and what they cover:\n\nData scope\nWhat is data scope?\nHow to determine the termporal, taxonomic, and spatial scope of available data for your study\nAccessing data\n\nWhere to get data from?\nHow to download data using R\nHow to refine download queries\nFirst steps in data inspection\n\nData cleaning\n\nString manipulation\nTaxonomic standardisation (synonyms, naming authorities, duplicates)\nSpatial data cleaning\nOutlier detection\n\n\nThe areas of research and uses of biodiversity data are many and varied. Here we have focused on just one facet - downloading and cleaning georeferenced occurrence / biodiversity data. As such, this book will not cover:\n\nHypothesis testing or experimental design\nHow to clean environmental data that is not occurrence / biodiversity data (e.g. trait data)\nHow to perform analyses (e.g. species distribution modelling)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no one size fits all workflow.\nData cleaning steps are frequently completed in entirely different orders, and this is just one example of a data cleaning workflow. Although it is possible to follow this book sequentially, this book does not have to be used in a linear fashion. While some steps may logically come first, they may need to be revisited after completing another."

    "text": "“Garbage in, garbage out” - George Fuechsel, IBM computer programmer\n\nThere is an ever growing interest and need in understanding spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity across the globe. To this end, georeferenced biodiversity data are often used for a variety of ecological questions, such as in species species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and invasive species monitoring to name a few.\nOpen source biodiversity datasets are widely available online, which are invaluable and often essentialresources for such investigations. However, it is well known in many scientific displines that inputting flawed or nonsensical data produces an output of similar quality. In ecology and biodiversity research, scientists are particularly at risk of unintentionally using poor data because they often bring together large amounts of data from many sources to address their research questions. Data from different sources vary widely in their structure, formatting and quality. As a result, correctly collating and combining them can be both challenging and time consuming. Besides this, georeferenced biodiversity data itself can pose several challenges, as issues can range from simple formatting errors, to taxonomic inconsistencies and spatial errors.\nBiodiversity data aggregation services employ automated quality control procedures to identify and flag potential errors. However, these services deal with high volumes of data, and not all issues can be identified. Therefore it is always recommoneded that users of biodiversity data perform their own quality control before using any open source biodiversity data in their research.\nData cleaning, the process of identifying and fixing incompatible, incorrect or doubtful data, is therefore an essential step in ecology and biodiversity research. Employing suitable data cleaning procedures will improve data quality and the validity of scientific findings (Rodrigues et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\nRodrigues, A. V., Nakamura, G., Staggemeier, V.

    "text": "A good first step to understanding what data are available is to check the number of observations across different time periods. To do this, we are using the galah package to query the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), which is the largest biodiversity data aggregator in Australia.\nFirst we load the galah package, and provide our registered ALA email address to the galah_config() function.\n\n\nLoad required packages\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(tidyverse) # group of packages\n\n\n\n# Provide your registered ALA email address\ngalah_config(email = \"youremail@here.com\")\n\nThe atlas_counts() function returns a count of records.

In this case, we narrow the search to only include insects.\n\n# Query all records\natlas_counts()\n\n# Query only insects\n1galah_call() |&gt;\n2  galah_identify(\"insecta\") |&gt;\n3  atlas_counts()\n\n\n1\n\nStart building a data query\n\n2\n\nNarrow the query with taxonomic identifiers\n\n3\n\nReturn the count of records\n\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      count\n      &lt;int&gt;\n1 130763839\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    count\n    &lt;int&gt;\n1 5773782\n\n\nNow let’s see how many insects have been observed each year over the last 10 years.

We’ll first make sure the scientific name Lampromicra returns the taxon information we expect with search_taxa().\nqjg search_taxa(\"Lampromicra\")\nThis looks correct!

Alternatively, we might decide to only include data since 2020, which might be sufficient to represent where Lampromicra are found and be more relevant because they are more recent observations. These are decisions that might affect the granularity of the research question we ask."

    "text": "6.1 Metadata\nMetadata describes your data set: it defines each variable and its contents. This might be describing what units a variable has been measured in, or, the climate the occurrence was collected in and whether it is a marked outlier. Starting the process of pre-cleaning by briefing your metadata allows you to understand the kind of data you are working with and any potential biases that may limit what you can do with it. Similarly, these biases may need to be of consideration when creating models or when used in your work more broadly.\nData infrastructures that use Darwin Core terms will have interoperable metadata. This makes it easier to consolidate across data sets. All Darwin Core term definitions can be found here, we suggest using Ctrl/CMD F and searching your variable name on the webpage. Don’t hesitate to Google variable names if you are unsure what they represent.\nIt is also worth checking the metadata for the entire dataset to delineate if there is extra information about the data which may be relevant. You could Google the dataset name, or search the dataset or institution on the ALA. The metadata on the ALA is submitted with the data, of which the ALA as a repository and not an owner cannot change. This means low-quality metadata cannot necessarily be vetoed.\nAn example of some good metadata is FrogID from the Australian Museum. From reading FrogID’s metadata (Rowley and Callaghan 2020), you’ll find:\n\nThe data is acoustic data, the majority of the species recorded are therefore male\nBecause this is citizen science data, it is especially biased towards populated areas\nAudio is recorded via a smartphone app, the authors recommend if you require high coordinate precision to filter data to geographic uncertainty of &lt;3000m\nThe data is presence only data\n\nMetadata can also be useful for understanding the license that the data falls under. This is mostly relevant for using or republishing multimedia associated with the data."

    "text": "6 Appendix: Naming Authorities\nAccurate species delimitation is also crucial for adequate conservation management and understanding evolutionary processes (Mace 2004). Species level lists are the foundation of many conservation decisions: such as the IUCN conservation status classification system. Taxonomic scope therefore has an effect on research application impacts.\nDeciding what naming authority to use can be challenging. What you choose will depend on your own taxonomic research and evaluation, but also your research scope.\nThe Atlas of Living Australia uses the following priority list of naming authorities:\nThese authorities provide a list of accepted and authoritative names as a template. If you’re unsure what naming authority to use and you’re looking at Australian species, the APNI and the AFD are a good place to start, especially if the data you’re investigating covers a wide range of taxa. If you’re investigating specific taxa it’s worth checking when the taxonomy was last updated in the APNI or AFD, especially if you know there has been recent changes. If you want to investigate closer, we’ve provided some links to society groups, in some cases these can be more up to date that the APNI or AFD.\ninsert a mapped example of data changes when changing taxonomic naming authority?"

    "text": "5.1 Where to get data from\n\n5.1.1 Global\nThe Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an international network and data infrastructure, stores global biodiversity data from many sources around the world. GBIF consists of a series of ‘node’ organisations who collate biodiversity data from their own regions and countries, with GBIF acting as an overarching organisation to store data from all nodes. Users that are interested in obtaining data that has global coverage may want to download directly from GBIF.\n\n\n5.1.2 Regional\nAlternatively, using a regional node may be more relevant if your project is at a smaller scale. For example, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is the Australian node, Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr) is the Brazilian node, and GBIF Sweden is the Swedish node. Living Atlases like the ALA ingest and aggregate data from a broad range of providers such as government monitoring programs, museums and herbaria, research projects and citizen science initiatives.\nTo see what national and regional nodes exist, check out this page.\nSome regional nodes like the ALA and SiBBr use their own taxonomic backbone for classification, which might differ from the taxonomic backbone of other regional or global infrastructures like GBIF. These taxonomic classifications can be useful for classifying local flora and fauna, and accepted by experts of the region. It’s worth being aware of what Section 5.2.1.1 are used to error caused by classification later on.\n\n\n5.1.3 Data providers\nIf your project relates to data from a specific data provider, it might be best to download data directly from the source. For example, a common citizen science tool to collect species observations is iNaturalist. Downloading directly from the data provider may ensure you don’t have any stray data from other sources."

Species names and taxonomic groups in these lists vary as there may be disagreements between lists about what distinguishes a new genus, species, subspecies etc. Taxonomy is hard!\nSome data (especially from open source repositories) can contain data with conflicting taxonomies from different naming authorities. This difference can cause unexpected errors later in an analysis if you are unaware of which naming authorities were used in your data.\nChoosing a naming authority is, then, one one way to make decisions surrounding taxonomic categorisations of biodiversity data.\nBefore starting your analysis, it’s useful to:\n\nBe aware of which naming authority is accepted for your taxonomic group of interest.\nCheck changes in the taxonomy of your focus species.\nDouble check for updates, as most taxonomic society groups also release annual updates on taxonomy.\n\nIn the Atlas of Living Australia, the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) is the primary naming authority for plants. With the Australian Faunal Directory (AFD) the main taxonomic catalog for animal species. For a full list, see the appendix.\nData that does not match the preferred naming authority or contains data from multiple naming authorities may need to be matched to a single taxonomic backbone  .\nNow that you’ve chosen a naming authority you can use it to ensure consistency across your data set, but also check you haven’t missed any species data from your download.\n\n5.2.2.1 Searching by classification\nInclude the original name that was recorded by the data provider in your download. This is often referred to as verbatimScientificName. or vernacularname\n\nInclude synonyms of the species names you’re interested in your download\n\n\nlibrary(galah)\n\ngalah_call() |&gt;\n  galah_filter(year &gt; 2019) |&gt;\n  atlas_counts()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n     count\n     &lt;int&gt;\n1 26713599\n\n\nMany developers have created R packages to interact with each data infrastructures’s API to aid access to biodiversity data. Here are a few examples, we recommend taking a look at each package’s documentation to choose one that suits your project.\n\nrgbif an interface to GBIF\ngalah an interface to a number of living Atlases, as well as GBIF\nrinat an interface to iNaturalist observations\nrebird an interface with the eBird webservices.\nspocc a R package to query and collect species occurrence data from various sources including VertNet, iDigBio and others.\n\nOne benefit of using galah is that enables users to acquire not only species occurrence records but also taxonomic information, or associated media such as images or sounds. Below we have included some code blocks for downloading occurrence data with galah from GBIF and a Spain node.\n\n\n5.2.2.2 GBIF data via galah\nFirst, we have to configure galah. This is where you supply your account credentials and set the atlas to a particular region. See ?galah_config for more configuration options. You can save these credentials in your .Renviron so you don’t have to enter it explicitly in code.\nWe will be downloading all occurrences for the African Elephant from GBIF.

Shapefiles are [a file with points to make an outline, they can be simple or complex].\nIn R, using shapefiles requires using a package for handling spatial data like the {sf} package. [This is because the sf package helps transform & edit our shapefile to be plotted using longitude and latitude using a specified coordinate reference system - define.]\nHere is a simple polygon we have constructed for a theoretical “site A”. We use st_as_sf() and st_set_crs() from the convert our shapefile to a spatial object in R, then set its coordinate reference system. This allows us to plot this object with {ggplot2}.\nUsing shapefiles allows us to return data for very specific shapes, and are useful for long-term analyses of observations in specific regions or areas."

    "text": "5.4 Refining your data download\n\nOpen access biodiversity data comes from many different data sources, (eg. government monitoring programs, museums, herbaria, research projects, citizen science apps). As such, data type and quality can vary considerably. For example, museums harbour older records that are associated with a preserved specimens. These data often contain lots of extra information (metadata) about a specific specimen and its location. Alternatively, data sourced from citizen science apps like iNaturalist or eBird are associated with images or sounds captured from a smart phone. These data might contain less metadata of each observation, but, thanks to phones’ accurate location services, are quite accurate about the time and location of an observation.\nRefining your download query ensures higher quality data and also reduces the download size as many data infrastructures impose constraints to download size. Below we have illustrated how you can refine your query a few quality measures using galah_filter.\n\n5.4.0.1 By Year\nGenerally, old data records tend to be insufficient or less reliable as taxonomic knowledge and GPS tools were not readily available. For this reason, many users consider removing all occurrence records before a certain year to increase data precision (Gueta and Carmel 2016; Marsh et al. 2022) .\nChoosing the year ‘cut-off’ is relatively arbitary, but the most commonly used year is 1945 (Zizka et al. 2020; Führding-Potschkat, Kreft, and Ickert-Bond 2022), although some studies discard all data collected before 1990 (Gueta and Carmel 2016; Marsh et al. 2022).\nHere we will narrow the Pink Robin query from above to records after 1945 using galah_filter:\n\npink_robin_post1945 &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_identify(\"Petroica rodinogaster\") %&gt;%\n  galah_filter(year &gt; 1945) %&gt;%\n  atlas_occurrences()\n\n\n\n5.4.0.2 Basis of record\nBasis of record is a Darwin Core term that refers to the specific nature of the occurrence record. It can be used to refine your data download and ensure consistency when consolidating data from multiple organisations (Führding-Potschkat, Kreft, and Ickert-Bond 2022).\nThere are 6 different classes for basis of record:\n\nLiving Specimen - a specimen that is alive, e.g. a living plant in a national park\nPreserved Specimen - a specimen that has been preserved, for example, a dried plant on an herbarium sheet\nFossil Specimen - a preserved specimen that is a fossil\nMaterial Sample - a genetic or environmental sample\nMaterial Citation - A reference to, or citation of, a specimen in scholarly publications, e.g a citation of a physical specimen in a scientific journal\nHuman Observation - an output of human observation process e.g. evidence of an occurrence taken from field notes or an occurrence without any physical evidence\nMachine Observation - An output of a machine observation process e.g. a photograph, a video, an audio recording, a remote sensing image or an occurrence record based on telemetry.\n\nDepending on your data scope, it may be practical to limit data that can be traced to a physical specimen or observation (Godfree et al. 2021), which we do for the Pink Robin below\n\ntractable_records &lt;- c(\n  \"LIVING_SPECIMEN\",\n  \"PRESERVED_SPECIMEN\",\n  \"MATERIAL_SAMPLE\",\n  \"MACHINE_OBSERVATION\"\n)\n\npink_robin_tractable &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;%\n  galah_identify(\"Petroica rodinogaster\") %&gt;%\n  galah_filter(basisOfRecord == tractable_records) %&gt;%\n  atlas_occurrences()\n\n\n\n5.4.0.3 Assertions\nData infrastructures use assertions to internally grade the quality, completeness and consistency of each occurrence record. Assertions take values of either 1 or 0, indicating the presence or absence of the data quality issue. Note that assertions may vary depending what atlas you have configured to. You can see the available assertions and their descriptions using:\n\nshow_all(\"assertions\")\n\n# A tibble: 114 × 4\n   id                                 description                 category type \n   &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 AMBIGUOUS_COLLECTION               Ambiguous collection        Warning  asse…\n 2 AMBIGUOUS_INSTITUTION              Ambiguous institution       Warning  asse…\n 3 BASIS_OF_RECORD_INVALID            Basis of record badly form… Warning  asse…\n 4 biosecurityIssue                   Biosecurity issue           Error    asse…\n 5 COLLECTION_MATCH_FUZZY             Collection match fuzzy      Warning  asse…\n 6 COLLECTION_MATCH_NONE              Collection not matched      Warning  asse…\n 7 CONTINENT_COUNTRY_MISMATCH         Continent country mismatch  Warning  asse…\n 8 CONTINENT_DERIVED_FROM_COORDINATES Continent derived from coo… Warning  asse…\n 9 CONTINENT_INVALID                  Continent invalid           Warning  asse…\n10 COORDINATE_INVALID                 Coordinate invalid          Warning  asse…\n# ℹ 104 more rows\n\n\nOnce you have decided which assertions are important for your project you can further refine your download.

How specific your question can be may change depending on whether the majority of data is in only a few locations or evenly spread over the entire distribution of a species or taxonomic group.\nFor our example question about Lampromicra, we may wish to map where observations in Australia have been made. We can do this by using the {ozmaps} package to download a nice map of Australia, plot it with sf::geom_sf(), and add our observation points on top with geom_point().

    "text": "7.1 Taxonomy preclean\nSimilar to what we did in the previous chapter, we will apply a broad sweep pre-clean to taxonomic data. This will make dealing with synonyms go as smoothly as possible.\nThe process is to first identify the issue, correct it, check it, and then document the changes. The goal is to standardise and correct as many errors issues before removing records.\n\n7.1.1 Capitalisation\nNormally higher taxonomy are capitalised e.g. Myrtaceae or Aves. Capitalisation errors are usually quick to spot when you print the data object. Alternatively you can try using str_subset on columns you expect to have capital letters.\nThe code below subsets out unique values for the variable class that have upper case letters. Notice that no matches are found\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstr_subset(unique(bees$class), \"[:upper:]\")\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nWe can confirm that there are no upper case matches by subsetting unique values that have lower case letters to see what is going on. This shows us that Insecta is inputted entirely in lowercase.\n\nstr_subset(unique(bees$class), \"[:lower:]\") \n\n[1] \"insecta\"\n\n\nWe can correct the lower case formatting as below, remember to check the fix before overwriting/removing the erroneous column(s)\n\nbees |&gt; \n  mutate(class_corrected = str_to_sentence(class)) |&gt;\n  select(starts_with(\"class\"))\n\n# A tibble: 1,139 × 2\n   class   class_corrected\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          \n 1 insecta Insecta        \n 2 insecta Insecta        \n 3 insecta Insecta        \n 4 insecta Insecta        \n 5 insecta Insecta        \n 6 insecta Insecta        \n 7 insecta Insecta        \n 8 insecta Insecta        \n 9 insecta Insecta        \n10 insecta Insecta        \n# ℹ 1,129 more rows\n\nbees_corrected &lt;- bees |&gt; \n  mutate(class_corrected = str_to_sentence(class)) |&gt; \n  select(-class) |&gt; # Remove erroreous column \n  rename(class = class_corrected) # Rename corrected column as the new 'class'\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Seperators\nIn a taxonomic data, separators such as, spaces and underscore are found in scientific names and are used to delineate the genus and species name. While it is personal choice which separator you use, it is good practice to be consistent with your choice.

    "text": "7.2 Synonyms\nSynonyms is a complex issue when working with open source biodiversity data. Data infrastructures have their own taxonomic systems which may not align with researchers’ view or consistent with your chosen naming authority.\nKeeping in mind that there is no universal solution to synonymy. Best practice is to flag and correct synonyms in a clear and consistent manner. We recommend being explicit with your decisions about which names are retained and keeping a good record of the changes to aid transparency and reproducibility.\n\n{worrms}\nThe {worrms} is the R interface to the World Register of Marine Species and has a ability to cross check synonyms with their database for taxa that has an AphiaID.

    "text": "8.1 Joining datasets from different infrastructures\nIf you have downloaded data from different sources, you likely will need to collate your data into a singular database. It is important to make sure fields that have the same, are indeed the same variable, so prior to merging - take the time cross check the meta-data from different data providers (Ribeiro et al. 2022).\n\n8.1.1 Variable names and case format\nData providers will have their own naming conventions for variables. For example, World Register of Marine Species uses a combination of lower case e.g scientific_name and camel case e.g isExtinct. While the naming authority - Australian Fauna Directory (AFD) uses upper, snake case e.g. SCIENTIFIC_NAME. What format you choose is a matter of personal preference, the key is to be consistent.\nHere we will subset the variables we want, reformat them to the lower snake case names and then join by VALID_NAME\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nhabitat_data &lt;- worms %&gt;% \n  select(valid_name, starts_with(\"is\")) \n\nnames(habitat_data)[-1] \n\n[1] \"isMarine\"      \"isBrackish\"    \"isFreshwater\"  \"isTerrestrial\"\n[5] \"isExtinct\"    \n\nnew_names &lt;- str_split(names(habitat_data)[-1], pattern =  \"(?&lt;=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])\", n = 2) %&gt;%  # Seperate where case cases from lower to upper i.e. camel case\n  map(.x = ., \n      .f = ~tolower(.x)) %&gt;% # Convert to all lower case\n    map(.x = ., \n      .f = ~str_flatten(.x, \"_\")) %&gt;%  # Bind the two seperated elements\n  unlist()\n  \nnew_names\n\n[1] \"is_marine\"      \"is_brackish\"    \"is_freshwater\"  \"is_terrestrial\"\n[5] \"is_extinct\"    \n\n# Replace old with new\nnames(habitat_data)[-1] &lt;- new_names\n\n# Join habitat data by VALID_NAME\nafd %&gt;% left_join(habitat_data, by = join_by(VALID_NAME == valid_name))\n\n# A tibble: 49 × 37\n   GROUP_NAME HIGHER_CLASSIFICATION    KINGDOM PHYLUM SUBPHYLUM SUPERCLASS CLASS\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;\n 1 ANNELIDA   Phylum ANNELIDA, Class … ANIMAL… ANNEL… &lt;NA&gt;      NA         POLY…\n 2 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MAXI…\n 3 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MALA…\n 4 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… HEXAPODA  NA         INSE…\n 5 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MALA…\n 6 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… HEXAPODA  NA         INSE…\n 7 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MALA…\n 8 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MALA…\n 9 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         MALA…\n10 ARTHROPODA Phylum ARTHROPODA, Subp… ANIMAL… ARTHR… CRUSTACEA NA         OSTR…\n# ℹ 39 more rows\n# ℹ 30 more variables: SUBCLASS &lt;chr&gt;, SUPERORDER &lt;chr&gt;, ORDER &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   SUBORDER &lt;chr&gt;, SUPERFAMILY &lt;chr&gt;, FAMILY &lt;chr&gt;, SUBFAMILY &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   SUPERTRIBE &lt;lgl&gt;, TRIBE &lt;chr&gt;, SUBTRIBE &lt;lgl&gt;, GENUS &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   SUB_GENUS &lt;chr&gt;, SPECIES &lt;chr&gt;, SUB_SPECIES &lt;chr&gt;, AUTHOR &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   YEAR &lt;dbl&gt;, CHANGED_COMBINATION &lt;chr&gt;, VALID_NAME &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   COMPLETE_NAME &lt;chr&gt;, SYNONYMS &lt;chr&gt;, CHANGED_COMB_NAMES &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\nOne issue you might face is that higher taxonomy from different providers may not match.

Once this list is read into R, you can proceed to exclude invasive species from your data as below:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\ngriis_ls &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/lists/GRIIS_Australia_20230331-121730.csv\"))\n\nglimpse(griis_ls)\n\nRows: 2,979\nColumns: 16\n$ scientific_name                  &lt;chr&gt; \"Oenothera longiflora L.\", \"Lampranth…\n$ scientific_name_type             &lt;chr&gt; \"species\", \"species\", \"species\", \"spe…\n$ kingdom                          &lt;chr&gt; \"Plantae\", \"Plantae\", \"Plantae\", \"Pla…\n$ establishment_means              &lt;chr&gt; \"alien\", \"alien\", \"alien\", \"alien\", \"…\n$ is_invasive                      &lt;chr&gt; \"null\", \"null\", \"null\", \"null\", \"null…\n$ occurrence_status                &lt;chr&gt; \"present\", \"present\", \"present\", \"pre…\n$ checklist.name                   &lt;chr&gt; \"Australia\", \"Australia\", \"Australia\"…\n$ checklist.iso_countrycode_alpha3 &lt;chr&gt; \"AUS\", \"AUS\", \"AUS\", \"AUS\", \"AUS\", \"A…\n$ accepted_name.species            &lt;chr&gt; \"Oenothera longiflora\", \"Lampranthus …\n$ accepted_name.kingdom            &lt;chr&gt; \"Plantae\", \"Plantae\", \"Plantae\", \"Pla…\n$ accepted_name.phylum             &lt;chr&gt; \"Tracheophyta\", \"Tracheophyta\", \"Trac…\n$ accepted_name.class              &lt;chr&gt; \"Magnoliopsida\", \"Magnoliopsida\", \"Ma…\n$ accepted_name.order              &lt;chr&gt; \"Myrtales\", \"Caryophyllales\", \"Erical…\n$ accepted_name.family             &lt;chr&gt; \"Onagraceae\", \"Aizoaceae\", \"Ericaceae…\n$ accepted_name.habitat            &lt;chr&gt; \"[\\\"terrestrial\\\"]\", \"[\\\"terrestrial\\…\n$ accepted_name                    &lt;lgl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n\n# Note which species matched with GRIIS list\nmatches &lt;- plants |&gt; filter(scientific_name %in% griis_ls$accepted_name.species)\nmatches\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 13\n  record_id    scientific_name vernacular_name kingdom phylum class order family\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 94df1223-4c… Lysimachia jap… Creeping Loose… Plantae Trach… Magn… Eric… Primu…\n2 8055e15e-36… Lysimachia jap… Creeping Loose… Plantae Trach… Magn… Eric… Primu…\n# ℹ 5 more variables: genus &lt;chr&gt;, species &lt;chr&gt;, subspecies &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   latitude &lt;dbl&gt;, longitude &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n# Exclude GRIIS matches\nplants_no_griis &lt;- plants |&gt; filter(! scientific_name %in% matches)\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Extinct species\nIn most cases, a year filter during in your download query should remove most extinct species.\nYou want to cross check for extinct species using the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG). The list is comprehensive and actively maintained, the only caveat is that a lot of its data doesn’t go down to species level. As such, we recommend using the following approach to find potentially extinct taxa and further investigate the records that we are flagged.\nThe required files are organised by year and can be downloaded from here. Once you have unzipped the file in your projected directory, we need to process the list a littlerbefore we use it to exclude extinct species.\n\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n# Taxonomic info\nirmng_taxa &lt;- fread(\"data/lists/IRMNG_genera_DwCA_2023-05-19/taxon.txt\", na.strings = c(\"\"), quote=\"\")\n\n# Species profile\nirmng_sp &lt;- fread(\"data/lists/IRMNG_genera_DwCA_2023-05-19/speciesprofile.txt\", na.strings = c(\"\"), quote=\"\")\n\n\n# Precleaning \nawc_pattern &lt;- \"(awaiting allocation)\"\ninsed_pattern &lt;- \"incertae sedis\"\n\ncleaned_irmng_taxa &lt;- irmng_taxa |&gt; \n  mutate(class = ifelse(str_detect(class, pattern = paste0(awc_pattern,\"|\", insed_pattern)),\n                        word(class), class) # Remove pesky values\n         ) |&gt; \n  filter(taxonomicStatus == \"accepted\") |&gt; # Filter to accepted names \n  filter(kingdom %in% c(\"Animalia\", \"Plantae\"),\n         !

Coordinate precision can vary between data sources and recording equipment. For example, coordinates recorded with a GPS unit or a phone generally has higher precision compared to those manually determined from locality descriptions.\nCoordinate precision below 100km represents the grain size of many macroecological analyses (Zizka et al. 2020).  Some studies have used a cut-off of spatial resolution &gt;25,000m or precision with less than three decimal places (Godfree et al. 2021). Rasterised collections often have a significant proportion of records that might have low coordinate precision.\nDepending on the scope of your research question, you may need to limit your occurrence data to a certain level of coordinate.\nWe recommend first including coordinatePrecision in your download query and excluding its completeness and range before you exclude any data.\n\nlibrary(galah)\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nbanksia_serrata &lt;- galah_call() |&gt; \n  galah_identify(\"banksia_serrata\") |&gt; \n  galah_filter(year &gt; 2022) |&gt;  \n  galah_select(group = \"basic\", coordinatePrecision) |&gt; \n  atlas_occurrences()\n\n# banksia_serrata |&gt; \n#   select(coordinatePrecision) |&gt; \n#   skim()\n\n# Filter by number of decimal places\n# banksia_serrata |&gt; \n#   filter(coordinatePrecision &lt; XXX)"

As always we’ll start with fixing data before discarding, many coordinates issues can be solved with data manipulation instead of discarding:\nFlipped coordinates: Flipped coordinates typically appear as a clustering of points, whereby swapping the latitude and longitude will place the coordinates where they are expected. (Jin and Yang 2020)\n\n#example map of some flipped coordinates (what to look for) \n# https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/3013406216 this has flipped coordinates, which GBIF has corrected\n# https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?q=mammalia&continent=SOUTH_AMERICA&has_coordinate=true&has_geospatial_issue=false&issue=PRESUMED_SWAPPED_COORDINATE&advanced=1. ## the issue and flag is called 'presumed swapped coordinate' \n\nNumerical sign confusion: As with flipped coordinates, if there is a clustering of points mirrored to another hemisphere, consider swapping the sign and correct rather than discarding the points.\n\n#example map, like coordinates off the coast of japan\n\n# https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=lsid%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fid.biodiversity.org.au%2Ftaxon%2Fapni%2F51360942&qualityProfile=CSDM&radius=50&lat=35.66845370835343&lon=138.9990234375#tab_recordsView\n\n# eucs &lt;- galah_call() %&gt;% \n#  galah_identify(\"Eucalyptus\") %&gt;%\n#  galah_filter( year == 2005, \n#             dataResourceName == \"The University of Melbourne Herbarium (MELU) AVH data\") %&gt;%\n#  atlas_occurrences()\n\nCountry field doesn’t match coordinates: The coordinates could be wrong or just the country listed.\n\n## this doesnt seem to be very common- atleast not in ALA data- because there is no neighboring country\n# https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/a34fca43-9e7c-4b37-8fe4-07cc18369465 Australian coordinates, country listed as Trinidad and Tobago\n# https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?advanced=true&continent=SOUTH_AMERICA&geometry=POLYGON((-78.74961%20-8.25249,-76.29838%20-8.25249,-76.29838%20-4.74121,-78.74961%20-4.74121,-78.74961%20-8.25249))&has_coordinate=true&issue=COUNTRY_MISMATCH&locale=en&q=reptilia   # GBIF example- reptiles located in Peru, originally recorded as Ecuador\n\n\n9.3.1 Quick visualisation\nOne of the most straightforward ways to check for spatial errors is to plot your data onto a map.

In some cases, it’s worth checking the literature before discarding records like these. These can also be mis-identified species, if you’re working with data from many species, and you find a species point in amongst the environmental bounds of a similar looking species it might be worth going back to the original record and taking a closer look. However, if no images exist it might be difficult to determine if it is a taxonomic or spatial issue.\n\n\n\n\n9.5.1 Remove records with coordinates assigned to country and province centroids\nCentroids are common when records are being assigned from georeferencing based on vague locality descriptions or from incorrect georeferencing. Sometimes, records are erroneously entered with the physical location of the specimen or because they represent individuals from captivity or grown in horticulture, which were not clearly labelled as such.\n\n\n9.5.2 Remove records from biological institutions\nsuch as botanic gardens, zoos, country capitals, biodiversity institutions, urban areas, and GBIF headquarters. In some cases these records will haven actually been recorded at a zoo for example, in other cases this is often incorrectly georeferenced records. They can be tricky to spot but there are a few packages that deal with centroid data. Exploratory visuals can also help support findings, making it easier to spot clusterings of points.\nIn a few cases, zoos and botanic gardens might be where the record was sighted. However, in this case, it is not naturally occurring and should be removed. Records in urban areas may not want to be removed by everyone, but it is essential to note that it could be old data or have vague locality descriptions.\nRemove records outside of the country of interest: In some cases, records outside the country of origin may be outliers. In other cases, they may be perfectly valid. It is important to analyze case-by-case and remove the record if necessary.\n\n\n9.5.3 CoordinateCleaner\n\n\n\n\nGodfree, Robert C., Nunzio Knerr, Francisco Encinas-Viso, David Albrecht, David Bush, D.
