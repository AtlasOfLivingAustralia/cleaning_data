    "text": "Welcome\nData cleaning is the exploration, detection and correction of erroneous data. The standard of what ‘clean’ data looks like varies considerably across projects and data sources. This means that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.\nOur goal in creating this resource was to assist researchers and decision makers that may have limited experience with cleaning geo-referenced biodiversity data in R.\nIn this book, we provide an overview of a typical data cleaning workflow - from acquisition, to identifying potential errors to correction. Throughout each chapter, we include practical guidelines, R code blocks and additional resources that may aid with each data cleaning step.\nThe content of this book is guided by the current state of biodiversity literature on preparing data for species distribution modelling. For more details about how this was done, please refer to the Appendix. All resources that have been consulted for this book can be found in References."
