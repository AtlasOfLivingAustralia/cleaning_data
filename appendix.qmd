# Appendix {#sec-appendix}

We don't claim to be experts in data cleaning, therefore in order to
ensure content for this book was current and relevant we undertook an
informal literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature.
Key themes searched were:

1.  Cleaning data for species distribution models

2.  Cleaning open biodiversity data

3.  Australian and global naming authorities

4.  R packages for biodiversity data cleaning
