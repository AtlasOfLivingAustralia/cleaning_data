# Appendix {#sec-appendix}

Ecological data is complex, and we are not experts in cleaning all types of data for all types of ecological analyses. We do, however, work with ecological data on a daily basis and encounter many of these data cleaning issues in our own work. Still, we aspired for this book to be an up-to-date resource for a diverse range of data cleaning tasks.

In order to
ensure content for this book was current and relevant we undertook an
informal literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature.

The key themes we searched for were:

1.  Cleaning data for species distribution models

2.  Cleaning open biodiversity data

3.  Australian and global naming authorities

4.  R packages for biodiversity data cleaning

We tried to select more recently published papers as R and its available tools are rapidly evolving. Methods
sections outlining data cleaning protocols were read and collated into a
database. Papers which were frequently referenced were also chosen for
review in order to not miss older seminal papers. Additionally our
project partners outputs [@marsh2021; @godfree_implications_2021] have
been investigated in detail to understand and streamline their data
cleaning processes. This has included detailed review of their code base
as well as meetings with the authors of the papers to understand their
processes, issues and needs.

All steps for acquiring and cleaning data were then looked at together
in order to understand what were essential steps, versus what was done
in certain use cases. We also investigated the order in which steps were
undertaken with the idea of developing a streamlined workflow. However the diagrams below show the complexity of this, with data cleaning being extremely iterative.

## Why do we still have to clean data held in data infrastructures?

Data infrastructures aggregate data from thousands of different data providers, and standardise them so that data from many disparate sources can be used together. 

Data providers, however, can provide data with mistakes, and data infrastructures are not the ultimate taxonomic or ecological experts. Ultimately, it's a team effort to catch errors, and it's up to data providers to double check that any flagged errors are indeed actually errors. 

## Data scope

Data scope refers to the type and extent of data needed for your project.
Defining your scope is an essential part of forming a research question,
ultimately impacting what data you will use in your project. Availability of
data may therefore influence your scope and research question.

For example, you might have a question about several species in the same area.
However, data for one or more of those species could be limited because
observations are rare, surveying the area where it lives is difficult, or only
several historical records exist. 

Without narrowing your data scope, you might find yourself downloading more data
than you need, which can needlessly increase how much time is spent processing
data prior to analyses. Alternatively, you might find there isn't enough data to
answer your question.

While there are workable methods to analyse small sets of biodiversity data
(e.g. [hulls](https://labs.ala.org.au/posts/2022-10-12_alpha-hulls/post.html)),
it's worth thinking critically about whether the amount of data available will
allow you to sufficiently answer your research question.

To start, some initial questions you might ask are:

-   What is the **temporal** unit relevant for your research question?

    *Am I only interested in more recent data? Is there data that are too old to
    be relevant for my question?*

-   What is the **taxonomic** unit of your proposed research question?

    *Is my question specific to one or more species in the same taxonomic group?
    Does it compare between higher taxonomic levels like genus, family or
    order?*

-   What is the **spatial** scale of your proposed research question?

    *Is my question relevant at a global or national level, or is it specific to
    a region or ecosystem?*

Questions like these will help you define what data is most relevant for your
research question, and help you begin to think about how much evidence
available, and the trade-offs you might make between the specificity of your
question and the certainty of your answer.
