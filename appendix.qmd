# Appendix {#sec-appendix}

We don't claim to be experts in data cleaning, therefore in order to
ensure content for this book was current and relevant we undertook an
informal literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature.
Key themes searched were:

1.  Cleaning data for species distribution models

2.  Cleaning open biodiversity data

3.  Australian and global naming authorities

4.  R packages for biodiversity data cleaning

As this was not a comprehensive literature review recent papers were
selected first as the R environment is a rapidly evolving space. Methods
sections outlining data cleaning protocols were read and collated into a
database. Papers which were frequently referenced were also chosen for
review in order to not miss older seminal papers. Additionally our
project partners outputs [@marsh2021; @godfree_implications_2021] have
been investigated in detail to understand and streamline their data
cleaning processes. This has included detailed review of their code base
as well as meetings with the authors of the papers to understand their
processes, issues and needs.

All steps for acquiring and cleaning data were then looked at together
in order to understand what were essential steps, versus what was done
in certain use cases. We also investigated the order in which steps were
undertaken with the idea of developing a streamlined workflow. However the diagrams below show the complexity of this, with data cleaning being extremely iterative.
