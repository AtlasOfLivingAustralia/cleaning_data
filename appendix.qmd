# Appendix {#sec-appendix}

Ecological data is complex, and we are not experts in cleaning all types of data for all types of ecological analyses. We do, however, work with ecological data on a daily basis and encounter many of these data cleaning issues in our own work. Still, we aspired for this book to be an up-to-date resource for a diverse range of data cleaning tasks.

In order to
ensure content for this book was current and relevant we undertook an
informal literature review of both peer reviewed and grey literature.

The key themes we searched for were:

1.  Cleaning data for species distribution models

2.  Cleaning open biodiversity data

3.  Australian and global naming authorities

4.  R packages for biodiversity data cleaning

We tried to select more recently published papers as R and its available tools are rapidly evolving. Methods
sections outlining data cleaning protocols were read and collated into a
database. Papers which were frequently referenced were also chosen for
review in order to not miss older seminal papers. Additionally our
project partners outputs [@marsh2021; @godfree_implications_2021] have
been investigated in detail to understand and streamline their data
cleaning processes. This has included detailed review of their code base
as well as meetings with the authors of the papers to understand their
processes, issues and needs.

All steps for acquiring and cleaning data were then looked at together
in order to understand what were essential steps, versus what was done
in certain use cases. We also investigated the order in which steps were
undertaken with the idea of developing a streamlined workflow. However the diagrams below show the complexity of this, with data cleaning being extremely iterative.

## Why do we still have to clean data held in data infrastructures?

Data infrastructures aggregate data from thousands of different data providers, and standardise them so that data from many disparate sources can be used together. 

Data providers, however, can provide data with mistakes, and data infrastructures are not overarching taxonomic or ecological experts. Ultimately, it's a team effort to catch errors, and it's up to data providers to double check that any flagged errors are indeed actually errors.
