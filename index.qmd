# Welcome!

Data cleaning is the exploration, detection and correction of erroneous data. The standard of what 'clean' data looks like varies considerably across projects and data sources. This means that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach. 

Our goal in creating this resource was to assist researchers and decision makers that may have limited experience with cleaning geo-referenced biodiversity data in R. 

In this book, we provide an overview of a typical data cleaning workflow - from acquisition, to identifying potential errors to correction. Throughout each chapter, we include practical guidelines, R code blocks and additional resources that may aid with each data cleaning step. The content of this book is derived from our [informal review](#link to details maybe supplementary materials?) of the current state of biodiversity research. 

This work was inspired by an [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/) project where our team worked closely with research partners to streamline their data cleaning workflows.

## How to contribute

We would like to preface that we are not experts in data cleaning, however; we felt there was need for a consolidated resource to guide data cleaning decisions.

We welcome contributions to this document and suggest folks to submit pull requests at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/cleaning_data) where this document lives. Contributing guidlines can be found at XX
