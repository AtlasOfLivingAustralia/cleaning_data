# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is a practical guide on cleaning geo-referenced biodiversity data
using R. We focus on processes and challenges you'll face with
biodiversity data. As such, this book isn't a guide to data cleaning in general,
but a targeted resource for anyone working with or interested in ecology/evolution and geo-referenced 
biodiversity data.

#### Cover

The [Pacific Cleaner Shrimp (*Lysmata amboinensis*)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/55ed63d8-7382-4611-8016-08553e0fe20d) is a cleaning hero of coral reef ecosystems across the tropics. These shrimps clean parasites and dead tissue from "client" fish, which helps to heal wounds and improve health.

## Acknowledgement of Country

The Atlas of Living Australia acknowledges that we live and work on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lands, rivers, and seas. Indigenous Australian peoples held and continue to hold incomparably intricate environmental knowledge as first peoples of this country. We are working with communities to acknowledge and archive these different types of [knowledge](https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/) in a culturally sensitive way.

The authors of this book currently reside on Ngunnawal and Ngambri (Canberra), Wurundjeri and Bunurong (Melbourne), Turrbal and Yuggera (Brisbane), Kaurna (Adelaide), and Gadigal (Sydney) lands, and we pay our respects to Elders past and present.
