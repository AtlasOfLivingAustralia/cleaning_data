# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is a practical guide for cleaning geo-referenced biodiversity data
using R. It focuses specifically on the processes and challenges associated with
biodiversity data. As such, it is not a general guide to data cleaning but a
targeted resource for those working with or interested in ecology, evolution,
and geo-referenced biodiversity data.

#### Cover

The [Pacific Cleaner Shrimp (*Lysmata amboinensis*)](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/55ed63d8-7382-4611-8016-08553e0fe20d) is a cleaning hero of coral reef ecosystems across the tropics. These shrimps clean parasites and dead tissue from "client" fish, which helps to heal wounds and improve health.

## Acknowledgement of Country

The Atlas of Living Australia acknowledges that we live and work on Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander lands, rivers, and seas. Indigenous Australian
peoples held and continue to hold incomparably intricate environmental knowledge
as first peoples of this country. We are working with communities to acknowledge
and archive these different types of
[knowledge](https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/) in a
culturally sensitive way.

The authors of this book currently reside on the lands of the Ngunnawal and
Ngambri (Canberra), Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung and Bunurong (Naarm/Melbourne),
Turrbal and Yuggera (Meanjin/Brisbane), Kaurna (Tarntanya/Adelaide), and Gadigal
(Gadigal/Sydney) peoples. We pay our respects to Elders past and present.
