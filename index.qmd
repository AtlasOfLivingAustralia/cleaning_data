# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This book is a practical guide on cleaning geo-referenced biodiversity data
using R. We focus on processes and challenges you'll face with
biodiversity data. As such, this book isn't a guide to data cleaning in general,
but a targeted resource for anyone working with or interested in ecology/evolution and geo-referenced 
biodiversity data.

## Acknowledgement of Country

The Atlas of Living Australia acknowledges that we live and work on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lands, rivers, and seas. Indigenous Australian peoples held and continue to hold incomparably intricate environmental knowledge as first peoples of this country. As a data repository we are working to acknowledge and archive in a culturally sensitive way many different kinds of this [knowledge with communities](https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/).

The authors of this book currently reside on Ngunnawal and Ngambri (Canberra), Wurundjeri and Bunurong (Melbourne), Turrbal and Yuggera (Brisbane), and Gadigal (Sydney) lands, and we pay our respects to Elders past and present.

research partners to streamline their data cleaning workflows. This book is a
collaborative effort from the [Science and Decision Support team](https://labs.ala.org.au/about/) at the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/)
