# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This resource has been created by the Science and Decision Support team at the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://www.ala.org.au/) to assist researchers and decision makers with cleaning biodiversity.

In this book we will first outline some assumptions about the data being used, and the importance and limitations of data cleaning, followed by practical guidelines and steps to be taken for data acquisition and cleaning.

You will also find resources and R packages that can be used to facilitate the data cleaning process. It's worth noting there are likely many ways to achieve the same results, all guidelines should be revised according to the data you have, and what you are trying to achieve.
