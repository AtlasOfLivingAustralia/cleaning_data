# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<!-- This website contains resources for working with occurrence data from
living atlases. It is suitable for those who wish to learn to download, tidy,
and transform species occurrence records. This process, often broadly referred
to as *data cleaning*, may vary based on the source of the data, or according to
the aims of the project. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach,
which is reflected in the way this site is structured.

Welcome to the Atlas of Living Australia Data Cleaning book. This book is
designed to be a practical guide on cleaning georeferenced biodiverdsity data
using R. We focus on specific processes and challenges you'll face with
biodiversity data. As such, this book isn't a guide to data cleaning in general,
but a targeted resource for anyone working with or interested in georeferenced
biodiversity data.
