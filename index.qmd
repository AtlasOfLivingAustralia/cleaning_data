# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<!-- This website contains resources for working with occurrence data from
living atlases. It is suitable for those who wish to learn to download, tidy,
and transform species occurrence records. This process, often broadly referred
to as *data cleaning*, may vary based on the source of the data, or according to
the aims of the project. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach,
which is reflected in the way this site is structured.

Welcome to the Atlas of Living Australia's Data Cleaning Booklet. This book is
designed to be a practical guide on cleaning georeferenced biodiversity data
using R. We focus on processes and challenges you'll face with
biodiversity data. As such, this book isn't a guide to data cleaning in general,
but a targeted resource for anyone working with or interested in georeferenced
biodiversity data.

## Acknowledgement of Country

The Atlas of Living Australia acknowledges that we live and work on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lands, rivers, and seas. Indigenous Australian peoples held and continue to hold incomparably intricate environmental knowledge as first peoples of this country. As a data repository we are working to acknowledge and archive in a culturally sensitive way many different kinds of this [knowledge with communities](https://www.ala.org.au/indigenous-ecological-knowledge/).

The authors of this book currently reside on Ngunnawal and Ngambri (Canberra), Wurundjeri and Bunurong (Melbourne), Turrbal and Yuggera (Brisbane), and Gadigal (Sydney) lands, and we pay our respects to Elders past and present.
