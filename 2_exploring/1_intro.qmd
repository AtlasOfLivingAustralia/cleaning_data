# Exploring biodiversity data

[previously called Data Scope]

This section details how to explore your dataset, create summaries of your dataset's structure and the different types of data within it.

## Demonstration

As an example, let's imagine we were interested in understanding more about the
distribution of several Jewel beetles in the genus *Lampromicra*. Let's see some
ways we might investigate what data are available about them in Australia.
