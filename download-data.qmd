# Download occurrence data {#sec-download-data}

There are many ways to obtain species or region of interest occurrence data. For example a literature based search using web search engines such as Google Scholar. Data can also be obtained directly from data infrastructure websites such as the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) or citizen science initiatives, such as [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/). Australia counts on the [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](www.ala.org.au), an open-access biodiversity database that aggregates data from a broad range of projects and initiatives, museums and universities, where data is uploaded directly into the platform.

An alternative to downloading data directly from project websites is to use R packages explicitly created for data occurrence downloads (see a list in chapter xx or below). The ALA has developed an R package exclusively to obtain data from the ALA. [galah](https://galah.ala.org.au/) enables users to locate and download species occurrence records (observations, specimens, eDNA records, etc.), taxonomic information, or associated media such as images or sounds, and to restrict their queries to particular taxa or locations.

## Merge datasets

When combining data from multiple places, it is important to standardize the data fields and merge the data carefully. There is a chance data will be incorrectly formatted and/or mislabeled.

## Familiarise with the data and metadata

Before you get started with any data cleaning, a visual inspection of the entire dataset can save time and solve easy-to-spot errors. It can improve your knowledge of the data you're working with and what you might be able to do or what you might be limited by. Taking the time to understand the metadata will provide context to the structure of the data and information on how the data was collected. It may also outline or provide insights into the limitations of the data.

A plot of the occurrence data on a map can follow it. This simple step can highlight coordinates with missing data or even inverted or erroneous coordinates (as points floating in the ocean while focusing on terrestrial species and vice versa).

Other tools, such as looking for only positive values if that is what is expected, can also be used in this initial data familiarization step.

## Initial clean-up

Although systematic data cleaning is required, some apparent mistakes observed during the initial visualization of the data and metadata can be fixed straight away. It includes removing records from unlikely sources, removing unnecessary details for the study, and fixing typos, incorrect capitalization and minor coordinates errors, such as inverted coordinates.

## Optional steps on data preparation

When handling data from the ALA, some filters can help obtain only the type of records required for the study. Filter by "basis of record", for example, can ensure consistency when getting data from multiple places. For example, it is possible to exclude data originating from citizen science projects or only include data from herbariums and natural history museums.
