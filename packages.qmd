### galah

{galah} is an R and Python interface to biodiversity data hosted by the
Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). It enables users to locate and download
species occurrence records (observations, specimens, eDNA records,
etc.), taxonomic information, or associated media such as images or
sounds, and to restrict their queries to particular taxa or
locations.<br> <br>

### rgbif

{rgbif} is the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)'s R
package for downloading global biodiversity occurrence data and is the
main node for all living atlases. Users can locate, restrict, and
download occurrence records of interest across the globe as well
associated multimedia. {rgbif} is one of four clients available to
retrieve data. It is also available in Python, Ruby and PHP languages.

multiple open-access biodiversity data repositories: GBIF, iNaturalist,
VertNet, eBird, iDigBio, OBIS and the Atlas of Living Australia.

### skimr

A helpful tool to quickly summarise your data, particularly prior to
data cleaning or whilst in the process of choosing an analysis. You can
also use the `skim` function to calculate the number of columns or rows,
view the number of empty or N/A data cells, and describe constituent
data types. The `summary` function provides summary statistics of
numerical data such as means, medians, minimum and maximums, as well as
quartiles. `skim` allows the user to have a basic grasp of the spread of
numercial data through averages, standard deviations and mini
histograms.

### tidyverse

{tidyverse} is an umbrella package installing many packages into R that
are useful for data wrangling, cleaning and analysis. Some notable
packages within the tidyverse are {dplyr}, {ggplot2} and {stringr}. For
example, you can use {dplyr} to add new columns to your data, filter
your data for certain values and arrange rows in a preferred order;
{ggplot2} can plot and visualise your data, and {stringr} can (though
not limited to) help you locate and fix typos and extra spaces in your
data.

### janitor

{janitor} is an effective R package to use for pre-cleaning data,
especially when working with large data sets. It can help prepare data
column names into a consistent format in order for combining data sets
or simply the ease of processing of data later on (`clean_names`). For
example, you might want to keep all column names lower case using
underscores instead. You can quickly find any duplicate records
(`get_dupes()`) using and produce counts of various combinations of
data.

### dwctaxon

{dwctaxon} is a package built for editing and validating Darwin Core (a biodiversity data structure that uses standardised row and column names) taxonomy data. As some species have lots of different accepted names or synonyms, this mismatch can impact the ability to merge varying datasets as the same species may be recognized as lots of different ones. It is useful for use as part of the cleaning and formatting process.
