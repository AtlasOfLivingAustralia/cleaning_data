# General data cleaning

This section details some steps and functions for cleaning a dataset in preparation for analysis. The aim is to address issues arising from data formatting through general cleaning tasks, such as removing duplicates, correcting dates, and handling missing or unexpected values.

The steps provided here are not meant to be followed in linear order. Instead, think of this section as a checklist or roadmap for data cleaning, rather than a comprehensive, step-by-step guide.
