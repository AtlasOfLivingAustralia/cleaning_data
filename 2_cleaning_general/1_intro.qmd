# General data cleaning

This section will detail some steps and functions to clean a dataset for analysis. **These steps will remove problematic values that are due to the data's formatting**, solved by more general data cleaning tasks. These tasks include removing duplicates, correcting dates, and removing or correcting missing or unexpected values.

The steps in this chapter are not linear, and they don't have to be done in order. We intend this section to be treated more like a checklist or a roadmap for data cleaning rather than a comprehensive, step-by-step guide.
