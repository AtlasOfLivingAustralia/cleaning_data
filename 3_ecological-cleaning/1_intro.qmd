# Ecological data cleaning

This section addresses data cleaning methods that leverage ecological and biological expertise. Not every step will be relevant to every dataset; the applicability of each step depends on the particular taxonomic groups and species included in your data.

The first chapter explains ways to search your taxonomy and verify there are no inconsistencies in taxonomic names. The second chapter covers methods to determine uncertainty in your dataâ€™s spatial coordinates. The third chapter demonstrates how to identify and resolve various geospatial issues in your data.
