# Outliers

#note from meeting with Martin this section might include some alpha hull examples for how to detect outliers, or how they can skew your data, in addition to maybe an SDM for outlier detection [@simoes2018utility] even if we won't be teaching people how to run an SDM

Outliers can be true outliers or data errors, true outliers are not necessarily to be removed. This could represent mis-identified specimens, etc

(#note to double check what i wrote for support article around inconsistent sampling and open source data)

- Alpha hull (some example species - check cailtin chat history)

- SDM Shandiya?
