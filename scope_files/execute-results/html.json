Depending on the data available your scope and research question may change. \n\nFor example, while your species could be **predicted to occur across a wide area**, data may only be **available in a certain locality** of that area. Records might be limited due to the rarity or difficulty of surveying the species.\n\nBiodiversity data of this nature can be analysed, but, depending on your question and the context, it is worth assessing whether this will reduce the granularity of your research. In other words, at this point you will need to think critically about how a shift in scope may impact your analysis.\n\nImportant questions to ask yourself are:\n\n-   What is the **taxonomic** unit of your proposed research question?\n\n    *A broader genera or a species? Is it threatened or sensitive?*\n\n-   What is the **spatial** scale of your proposed research question?\n\n    *The entire country? A specific conservation area?*\n\n## Taxonomic scope\n\n<!-- I don't think the tone is quite right on this section and might need some massaging to get right. I think we are trying to suggest that investigating what data is available is a necessary first step to understand how detailed you can get about a specific question. Then you should think critically about whether the available data is suitable. If it's viable to increase data scope, then this might be a useful way to increase data (but at the expense of granularity of detail)   -->\n\nTaxonomy is a way that we categorise and name organisms. It is a process that allows us to both distinguish and relate different species to one another. \n\nIt is always worth investigating *how much* data is available on your taxonomic unit of interest before you start your analysis. \n\n **Reducing** or **increasing** your taxonomic scope may be relevant for a few reasons:\n\n- Specific questions are being asked, and you need to refine your taxonomic scope so that the data only includes the targeted group.\n\n-   Your research requires more data and the research question or analysis is viable at a higher taxonomic level or grouping (genus, family, order, class..). \n\nLet's say we wanted to investigate the Green Jewel Bug and the Red Jewel Bug in Australia. We have no research question just yet. \n\nTo construct a query, use their scientific names  *Lampromicra senator* and *Lampromicra aerea*. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scope_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<aside>\n\nCurious what *Lampromicra senator* looks like?\n\n[![Lampromicra senator perched on a leaf by Dexmond Wells CC-BY-NC 4.0](images/Lampromicra.jpeg){width=\"800\"}](https://images.ala.org.au/store/4/8/8/4/1f4fc763-d21f-4e5d-b803-f931a4c14884/tms/3/2/1.png)\n\n</aside>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\naus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)\n\nlibrary(galah)\ngalah_config(email = \"ALAemailaddress\", atlas = \"Australia\")\n\nlampromicra <- galah_call() |>\ngalah_identify(\"Lampromicra aerea\", \"Lampromicra senator\") |>\ngalah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022) |>\ngalah_select(group = \"basic\") |>\natlas_occurrences()\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = \"#B7CD96\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = lampromicra,\n    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, color = scientificName),\n    size = 2,\n  ) +\n  ylim(-45, -10) +\n  xlim(110, 155) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's look at the Lampronica genus in Australia as a whole. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scope_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(galah)\ngalah_config(email = \"ALAemailaddress\", atlas = \"Australia\")\n\nlampromicra <- galah_call() |>\ngalah_identify(\"Lampromicra\") |>\ngalah_filter( year > 1950 & year <= 2022) |>\ngalah_select(group = \"basic\", genus) |>\natlas_occurrences()\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = aus, size = 0.05, fill = \"#B7CD96\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = lampromicra,\n    mapping = aes(x = decimalLongitude, y = decimalLatitude, color = genus),\n    size = 2,\n  ) +\n  ylim(-45, -10) +\n  xlim(110, 155) +\n  theme_void()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe sample data here looks very similar to our species-level sample. \n\nLooking at our data frame, there are around 40 more occurrence records in the genus level data. These might be occurrence records that have only been able to be identified to the genus level, or, they could be a cluster of another Lampromicra species that we have not queried here. \n\nRegardless, this is a good example of where you might make the decision to use species level data even if your research question addresses the genus level. There doesn't seem to be a large proportion of data only identified to the genus level (40 at most). In this case, refining your data to a species level will allow you to investigate genus related questions as well as allow a finer-grain analysis of species level distributions if found to be relevant to your analysis at any point. Alternatively, you could  note this distinction between the genus and species level data and download them both. \n\n\n## Spatial scope\n\n<!-- Same suggestion as in the above chapter that this might need some rewording to show how investigating data at different spatial scales is useful for defining what scope is realistic for your project/question. The goal (I think) might be to similarly show a preview of what investigating data by different sized regions might be useful (or checking which regions have the most data, and just working in that area).  -->\n\nIt is also useful to investigate how much data there are at different spatial scales for your research.\n\nIf your proposed research question is restricted to a particular area, you will need to adjust your spatial scope accordingly. Keep in mind though that some areas or regions might have more data than others for a variety of reasons.  \n\nTo define a spatial scope, you can:\n\n-   Outline the  **region name** in your data query (only download data in that region)\n\n-   Delineate **area boundaries** around your data (download a larger scale of data and draw boundaries)\n\n\nThe example below shows all **Insect orders** in the state of Tasmania, Australia:\n\n<!-- Note that we are plotting only 10% of all dataset here  -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scope_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Naming authorities\n\n<!-- Define what naming authority is -->\n\n<!-- How to choose -->\n\n<!--   query with your ideal species list, some systems fuzzy match and will have synonyms -->\n\n<!--     getting all the name columns including your own preferred naming authority to check if you back correct -->\n\n### Choosing your taxonomic naming authority\n\nNaming authorities are the different organisations that provide updated or revised lists of species, and where they fit on the taxonomic tree <!--Is this definition from somewhere? Might be good to try to find one (though in a quick google, this isn't easy-->. Species names in these lists vary as there may be disagreements as to what distinguishes a new genus, species, subspecies etc. <!--Again, might be good to find this from somewhere else because I don't think that's necessarily always why - some groups consider higher taxonomic clades unified or separate, so it's not just species/genera-->\n\nOpen source repositories are often provided with conflicting taxonomies that leave them open to a degree of error <!--Not sure if you wrote this but I think it's not clear what this means? I think this is referring to the fact that open source repositories might contain data from many taxonomies so they need to be checked and mapped according to one to avoid errors?-->.\n\nChoosing a naming authority is, then, one one way to make decisions surrounding taxonomic categorisations of open source biodiversity data. However, deciding what naming authority to use can be both challenging and time consuming.\n\nAccurate species delimitation is also crucial for adequate conservation management and understanding evolutionary processes ([Mace 2004](http://localhost:3271/references.html#ref-mace2004role)). Species level lists are the foundation of many conservation decisions: such as the IUCN conservation status classification system. Taxonomic scope therefore has an effect on research application impacts.\n\nWhat you choose will depend on your own taxonomic research and evaluation, but also your scope.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Note\n\nA spatial scope will have many species and may need multiple naming authorities. Similarly, choosing a naming authority may impact your scope by shrinking or enlarging datasets in that it will exclude records outside of that authority (unless converted). **This data change might influence your choice to use a naming authority from a single taxonomic society group or multiple broad sources.**\n:::\n\n<!-- I don't think I understand the above suggestion? I think you need to choose one authority to work from, but some might be more difficult to work with than others. In general, there is usually one or two authorities that are broadly agreed upon, so this shouldn't be too difficult. I'd suggest removing the note. -->\n\n-   Check changes in the taxonomy of your focus species.\n\n    This can be helpful when interpreting old data which may have species names you don't recognize, or, when using data citing a different naming authority to another data set you wish to consolidate it with. **This can be achieved by consulting the taxonomic literature.**\n\n-   Most taxonomic society groups also release annual updates on taxonomy.\n\nIn Australia, the [Australian Plant Name Index (APNI)](https://www.anbg.gov.au/apni/) is the primary naming authority for plants. With the [Australian Faunal Directory (AFD)](https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/home) the main taxonomic catalog for animal species.\n\nThese authorities provide a list of accepted and authoritative names as a template. If you're unsure what naming authority to use and you're looking at Australian species, the APNI and the AFD are a good place to start, especially if the data you're investigating covers a wide range of taxa. If you're investigating specific taxa it's worth checking when the taxonomy was last updated in the APNI or AFD, especially if you know there has been recent changes. If you want to investigate closer, we've provided some links to society groups, in some cases these can be more up to date that the APNI or AFD.\n\n**insert a mapped example of data changes when changing taxonomic naming authority?**\n\n<!-- The above seems like a difficult ask. Maybe we can find a good example from somewhere online? Maybe we can ask Fonti whether she had something in mind? I think we need an example of a group where this happens, and then create a small taxonomic tree to show these differences -->\n\n<!-- Is the below content things that were drawn on to write the above? Including references to be inserted? If it isn't, it seems to be repeating things and could probably be deleted. I do like Margot's image though! I think generally the book needs more visuals  -->\n\nFor example, the ALA uses multiple naming authorities in a hierarchical format:\n\n(note image is from a helpfile I wrote- we can re-do it so it's consistent with the style of this document)\n\n\\*\\*remake this? simplify? or remove entirely\\*\\*\n\n![](images/image-1066364510.png)\n\n<!-- Looking at this with fresh eyes makes me realise how much this overcomplicates what is communicated in this section. All we are trying to do is provide some examples of taxonomic authorities that a data infrastructure like the ALA uses, and that it's worth double checking this when you download open source data. I think this should be reduced to a table with only the left column included. -->\n\n\\*\\*make this shorter and include somewhere\\*\\*\\\n\\\nWith all that, open source data has many pros, so how does one deal with taxonomic inconsistencies to get the most accurate data in the end?\n\nWhile this is in theory how the ALAs backbone is built, issues can occur with aggregation leading to potentially serious problems with the taxonomic structure. In addition data can be parsed incorrectly, and the process isn't transparent. Meaning that when the taxonomic backbone is updated, the elements that have changed are untraceable. These issues are not specific to ALA taxonomy, but occur in varying forms among data aggregators.\n\n\n\n",
