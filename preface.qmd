# Preface {.unnumbered}

People working with ecological or biological data want to know how to clean data 
effectively, but data cleaning can be a daunting task because of the complexity
inherent in these types of data. At the [Atlas of Living
Australia](https://ala.org.au/), questions about data cleaning come up
so frequently that it made us wonder...*is there a general ecological
data cleaning workflow that is considered best-practice?*

To find out, we undertook an informal literature review on
ecological data cleaning processes using peer-reviewed and grey literature.
The key themes we searched for were:

1.  Data cleaning for species distribution models
2.  Data cleaning open biodiversity data
3.  Australian and global naming authorities
4.  R packages for biodiversity data cleaning

We created a collection of papers that matched these themes, choosing
recently published papers that used up-to-date workflows with
recent packages and tools in R. We also added several frequently
referenced papers for comprehensiveness, and we reviewed data cleaning
workflows from our project partners [@marsh2021;
@godfree_implications_2021] to understand their processes, issues, and
needs.

From our informal search, we ended up with a list of 18 papers and
resources (listed
[here](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/cleaning_data/blob/main/data/lit-search/informal-lit-search.xlsx))
with relevant ecological data cleaning workflows. To determine any
common, best-practice steps—and common sequences for ordering these steps—we read 
through their methods sections and collated their data
cleaning protocols into a spreadsheet. Our hope was that collating these
methods would reveal several clear data cleaning workflows that
scientists and researchers use regularly to clean their data.

But, to our surprise, that's not what we found. Instead, the steps to
cleaning ecological data were *even messier* than we first thought. The
diagrams below visualise the findings of our spreadsheet, showing the
complexity of processes used to clean data, many of which are iterative.

In the end, our search showed us that *there is no single, unified,
step-by-step workflow to clean all types of ecological data*. Instead,
data are cleaned in a **huge** variety of ways, and the process can look
completely different depending on the type of investigation. No wonder
people frequently ask how to do it!

This book is our response to questions about how to clean ecological
data, and to our discovery that (because workflows vary immensely) there
don't seem to be many resources that consolidate methods to clean
ecological data in R. We are by no means experts in cleaning all types
of data for all types of ecological analyses. We do, however, work with
ecological data on a daily basis and encounter many data cleaning issues
in our own work. We aspired for this book to be an up-to-date resource
for a diverse range of data cleaning tasks in R. We hope that (at the
very least) it is a resource that documents many common ecological data
cleaning steps in one place!
