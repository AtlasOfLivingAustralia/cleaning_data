# Introduction

> "Garbage in, garbage out" - George Fuechsel, IBM computer programmer

The idea that inputting flawed or nonsensical data produces an output of similar quality is well known in many scientific disciplines. In ecology and biodiversity research, however, scientists are often at risk of unintentionally using flawed or nonsensical data because they must bring together lots of data from many sources to address their research questions. These data are rarely easy to combine. Data from different sources vary widely in their structure, formatting and quality. As a result, collating them into something usable to answer a research question can be challenging.

**Data cleaning**, the process of identifying and fixing incompatible, incorrect or doubtful data, is an essential step in ecology and biodiversity research. Data cleaning improves data quality and the validity of scientific findings [@rodrigues_species_2022].

This book will guide you through how to acquire and clean open access biodiversity data in R. We will be working with point-based species occurrence data from online infrastructures such as [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF) and the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) (ALA). We will be working with the R package [`galah`](https://galah.ala.org.au/) for accessing biodiversity data. If you have occurrence data you have personally collected, some parts of this book may still be relevant.

We have included code blocks throughout to show you how to execute a particular task. We will point out at the beginning of the code block of any R packages that are needed for data cleaning or visualising.

## Outline: What you will learn

Cleaning open-access biodiversity data involves a few steps:

  A(Narrow data scope) --> B(Import data) --> C(Investigate metadata)
  C --> D{Cleaning}
  D --> E(Taxonomic issues)
  D --> F(Spatial issues)
```

Once data have been narrowed, imported and formatted correctly we can then start the major cleaning steps. We will focus on how to deal with the most common issues with biodiversity data:

[taxonomic standardisation]{.underline} problems, such as:

-   **varied species name synonyms**

-   **naming authorities and duplicates**

as well as [spatial errors and issues]{.underline}, like:

-   **suspicious outliers**

-   **duplicates.**

## Note

*No one size fits all in this workflow, and not all steps are relevant or possible depending on the nature of the study or the area of expertise possessed. As such, in the literature these steps are frequently completed in entirely different orders. Therefore we don't recommend this book to be necessarily used in a linear fashion. **While some steps may logically come first, you may need to go back to them after completing another.***

## What you won't learn

There are many important subject areas that this book will not cover. We won't be teaching you:

-   How to clean other data types e.g. environmental or trait data
-   How to run a species distribution model
-   Hypothesis testing or experimental design

## Prerequisites

### User accounts

To get data out of data infrastructures such as the Atlas of living Australia (ALA) or the Global Biodiversity Information (GBIF) you'll need to first create an account. You'll want to sign up for an account with the relevant data infrastructure. This book will use ALA and GBIF data as examples.

Atlas of Living Australia = [create an account](https://auth.ala.org.au/userdetails/registration/createAccount) Global Biodiversity Information Facility = [create an account](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile)

### R

Download R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (the comprehensive R archive network), for your operating system, and install it on your device. Major updates for R come out yearly with a few minor releases throughout the year, so make sure to update semi regularly.
