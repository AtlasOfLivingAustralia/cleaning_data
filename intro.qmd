# Introduction {.unnumbered}

> "Garbage in, garbage out" - George Fuechsel, IBM computer programmer

There is an ever growing interest and need in understanding spatial and temporal
patterns of biodiversity across the globe. To this end, georeferenced
biodiversity data are often used for a variety of ecological questions, such as
in species species distribution modelling, conservation planning, and invasive
species monitoring to name a few. 

Open source biodiversity datasets are widely available online, which are
invaluable and often essentialresources for such investigations. However, it is
well known in many scientific displines that inputting flawed or nonsensical
data produces an output of similar quality. In ecology and biodiversity
research, scientists are particularly at risk of unintentionally using poor data
because they **often bring together large amounts of data from many sources to
address their research questions.** Data from different sources vary widely in
their **structure, formatting and quality**. As a result, correctly collating
and combining them can be both challenging and time consuming. Besides this,
georeferenced biodiversity data itself can pose several challenges, as issues
can range from simple formatting errors, to taxonomic inconsistencies and
spatial errors. 

Biodiversity data aggregation services employ automated quality control
procedures to identify and flag potential errors. However, these services deal
with high volumes of data, and not all issues can be identified. Therefore it is
always recommoneded that users of biodiversity data **perform their own quality
control** before using any open source biodiversity data in their research.  

**Data cleaning**, the process of identifying and fixing incompatible, incorrect
or doubtful data, is therefore an essential step in ecology and biodiversity
research. Employing suitable data cleaning procedures will improve data quality
and the validity of scientific findings [@rodrigues_species_2022].
