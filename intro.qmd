# Introduction {.unnumbered}

> "Garbage in, garbage out" - George Fuechsel, IBM computer programmer

Data from different sources vary widely in their **structure, formatting and
quality**. As a result, collating and combining them into something usable to
answer a research question can be both challenging and time consuming.

The idea that inputting flawed or nonsensical data produces an output of similar
quality is well known in many scientific disciplines. In ecology and
biodiversity research, however, scientists are particularly at risk of
unintentionally using poor data because they **often bring together lots of data
from many sources to address their research questions.**

**Data cleaning**, the process of identifying and fixing incompatible, incorrect
or doubtful data, is an essential step in ecology and biodiversity research.
Data cleaning improves data quality and the validity of scientific findings
[@rodrigues_species_2022].
