# Introduction

> "Garbage in, garbage out"

The idea of flawed or sub-par input data produces nonsensical output is one that is well known in many scientific disciplines. In biodiversity research, scientists often have to collate large amounts of open access data from various sources to address their research question. This can be challenging as the quality of data can vary depending on the provider.

Data cleaning is therefore an essential step in biodiversity research. The process of identifying and fixing incorrect or doubtful data can improve data quality and the validity of scientific findings. [@rodrigues_species_2022].

This book will guide you through how to acquire and clean open access biodiversity data in R. We will be working with point-based species occurrence data from online infrastructures such as [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF) and the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) (ALA). If you have occurrence data you have personally collected, some parts of this book may still be relevant.

## What you will learn / Outline of the book

```{r}
# new diagram here
library(DiagrammeR)

```

- Import data
- Tidy and familiarise with meta-data

The major cleaning steps will focus on taxonomic and spatial issues.

- Investigate, flag and correct or remove: 
  - Taxonomic issues
    - Duplicates
  - Spatial data 
      - Outliers
      - Duplicates

## What you won't learn

-   How to clean other data types e.g. environmental or trait data
-   How to run a species distribution model
-   Hypothesis testing
