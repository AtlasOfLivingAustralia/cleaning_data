# Overview and structure {.unnumbered}

This book will guide you through how to acquire and clean open access
biodiversity data in R.

The common steps associated with cleaning open-access biodiversity data are
covered in this book:

- data scope
- downloading data
- exploring data and metadata
- cleaning data:
  - general cleaning
  - taxonomic names
  - spatial data

We place particular emphasis on some of the most common issues encountered with
biodiversity data:

[Taxonomic standardisation]{.underline} problems, such as:

- **varied species name synonyms**

- **naming authorities and duplicates**

as well as [spatial errors and issues]{.underline}, like:

- **suspicious outliers**

- **duplicates.**

**There is no one size fits all workflow**.

In the literature, we found that data cleaning steps are frequently completed in
entirely different orders. Not all steps are relevant or possible depending on
the nature of the study, or, the area of expertise possessed. Therefore this
book does not necessarily have to be used in a linear fashion. *While some steps
may logically come first, you may need to go back to them after completing
another.*

There are many important subject areas that this book will not cover. We won't
be teaching you:

-   How to clean environmental data that isn't occurrence / biodiversity data:
e.g. trait data -   How to run a species distribution model -   Hypothesis
testing or experimental design
