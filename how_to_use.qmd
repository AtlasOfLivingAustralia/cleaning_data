# How to use this book {.unnumbered}

This book provides an overview of biodiversity data cleaning using the R
programming language. Demonstrations and instructions are accompanied by
code blocks, which show how a particular task was executed. Code blocks may also
include comments which are preceded by a `#` symbol, and are not executed by R:

```r
# This is a code block with a comment
library(package)
plot(data)
```

Some code blocks may also be annotated, to help explain the sequence of steps:

```r
# This is a code block with annotation
cars |> # <1>
  filter(cars$speed > 20) |> # <2>
  summary() # <3>
```
1. Start building a data query
2. Narrow the query with taxonomic identifiers
3. Return the count of records
