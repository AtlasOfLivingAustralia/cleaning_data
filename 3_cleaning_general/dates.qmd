# Dates

Some use cases may require dates beyond a simple year value. Standardising dates
involves ensuring that the variables in a dataset have values that conform to a
consistent and standard format.  An example of unstandardised data is having
varied date formats (e.g. DD/MM/YYYY for some entries and MM/DD/YYYY for
others). This may be necessary when integrating data from multiple sources, but
it is important to remember that there can be inconsistencies even within a
single source dataset.
