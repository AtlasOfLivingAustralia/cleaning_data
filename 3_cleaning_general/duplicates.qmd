# Duplicates

Duplicates records can happen when using aggregated data sources. In this
section we will cover detection and handling of duplicate records. 

```{r}
# Check for duplicate records across the dataset
# duplicated_records <- merged_data[duplicated(merged_data), ]
# Targeted checks
# duplicated_records[which(duplicated(merged_data$occurrenceID)), ]
```
