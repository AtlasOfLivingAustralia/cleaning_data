# Requirements {.unnumbered}

This data cleaning book assumes some basic knowledge using R and RStudio, but if
you have never used R before there are a plethora of online and freely
accessible resources to help you get started.

- #TODO put some links here

### Packages

We will be working with the R package [`galah`](https://galah.ala.org.au/) for
accessing biodiversity data. If you have occurrence data you have personally
collected, some parts of this book may still be relevant.

- TODO also link to the packages page

Any additional `R packages` that are needed for data cleaning or visualising
will be noted at the beginning of the code block.

### User accounts

We will be working with point-based species occurrence data from online
infrastructures such as [Global Biodiversity Information
Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF) and the [Atlas of Living
Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) (ALA).

To get data out of data infrastructures such as the Atlas of living Australia
(ALA) or the Global Biodiversity Information (GBIF) you'll need to first create
an account.

**You'll want to sign up for an account with the relevant data infrastructure.
This book will use ALA and GBIF data as examples.**

You can do this for the Atlas of Living Australia
[here](https://auth.ala.org.au/userdetails/registration/createAccount) -

and for the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
[here](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile).

### R

Download R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/) for your operating system
and install it on your device. Major updates for R come out yearly, with a few
minor releases throughout the year - so make sure to update semi regularly.

### RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. R
operatees within R studio, so to code, you will need both R and RStudio.
Download and install RStudio for your operating system
[here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
