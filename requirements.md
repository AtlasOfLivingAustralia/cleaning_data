# Requirements {.unnumbered}

To get the most out of this book, a basic knowledge of using R and RStudio is
recommended. If you are new to R or need a refresher, there are many high
quality and freely available resources available online. [Data Analysis and
Visualisation in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/), and [R for Data
Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) are both excellent starting
points.

## Software requirements

### R

Download R from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/), selecting the version that
matches your operating system, and install it on your device.

### RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R programming. R
studio provides a range of tools to make working with R easier, and you can
download and install RStudio for your operating system [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

### Packages

We use a range of R packages throughout the book, primarily for data cleaning
and visualisations. These packages will be noted at the beginning of a code
block, typically at the start of a chapter. To access biodiversity data we will
be working with the [`galah`](https://galah.ala.org.au/) package. If you have
collected your own occurrence data, you should still find this book useful.

## User accounts

We will be working with point-based species occurrence data retrieved from
online infrastructures such as [Global Biodiversity Information
Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF) and the [Atlas of Living
Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) (ALA). To retrieve data from these services,
you will need to create a user account, if you do not already have one.
