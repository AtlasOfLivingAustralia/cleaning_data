<!-- This is just a placeholder title, I'm sure you can think of something better -->

This section is an opinionated list of aspects of science and programming that you may be interested in exploring next. Rather than writing about *how* to do these things, which has been covered elsewhere, we explain *why* we think you may be interested in these elements, and provide links to resources should you choose to investigate further.
