This outlines how to propose a change to X.

Fixing typos
Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the source file.

Prerequisites
Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal reprex.

Pull request process
We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
We use testthat. Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of NEWS.md below the current development version header describing the changes made followed by your GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
